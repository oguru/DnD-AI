1. In the ceremony at the end in Waterdeep, there should also be something for the other characters who had a hand in the journey (players characters). So i need something for that, perhaps not full statues, but maybe something around the statues? This should include Sirrush, Adalene, Ozdos, Gideon and Okurak as well as full, magical floating statues for the divine players Pyre, Pamykos, Kalmia, Khada and Yrsa. The ones who fell in battle (ozdos) should also have plaques or something.

2. Adalene (old player character who went to stay in a temple they cleared/cleansed), Ayana (demi goddess of chauntea, a druid npc), Ronar (leader of werebears), Ratan (wizard friend/helper), Arabella (paladin friend/helper), Old Bum (party friend/mascot) etc are there in Waterdeep at the end and greet the group. Portalled in by Ratan.
