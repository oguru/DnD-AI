- Clear objectives:
  - *"Reclaim the city from his followers."*
  - *"Destroy his temple and end his high priestess's corruption."*
  - *"Restore the natural flow of energy to the land using your combined divine power."*
  - *"Return to me when this is done, and your divine essence will grow."*

**Parting Words:**
