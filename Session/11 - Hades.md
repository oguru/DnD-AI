# The Gray Wastes - Final Confrontation

## Arrival in Hades

You emerge from the planar pathway into the Gray Wastes, immediately struck by the oppressive atmosphere. Here, color drains from everything - your vibrant equipment fades to muted grays, and even your divine auras appear washed out. The very air seems to leech hope and determination. As you come to your senses, you hear a deep reverberating voice boom through the air - "Welcome to your final resting place. I've been waiting for you... come to me, and meet your end once and for all."

### The Landscape
- Endless rolling hills of gray ash and dust stretch in all directions
- Twisted, leafless trees dot the barren landscape like gnarled fingers
- The sky is a uniform slate gray with no visible sun, yet there's dim, sourceless light
- In the distance, a massive obsidian tower pierces the gray sky - clearly Fazrahl's new domain

### The Draining Effect
- All colors become muted and gray within minutes
- Emotional dampening: The party must make Wisdom saves or feel their motivation waning
- Even their divine powers seem less vibrant, though no less potent

## The Journey to Fazrahl's Tower

### Encounter 1: The Despair Wraiths
As the party trudges through the gray wasteland, three massive wraiths composed of swirling gray mist rise from the ashen ground to block their path. These are the collected despair of mortals who have given up hope, drawn to the party's divine light like moths to flame.

**Combat Notes:**
- When defeated, they whisper: "He was once like you... pure of heart... but the darkness took him too... beware the call of night..."

### Encounter 2: The Void Sphere (Stinston Stallone)

As the party trudges through the gray wasteland, they notice a shimmering distortion ahead—a perfect sphere of absolute darkness hovering three feet above the ground. From within comes a familiar, panicked voice shouting magical incantations.

"I am Stinston Stallone, Architect of Portals Unseen, Astral Wayfarer, Master of Interdimensional Arc—" The voice suddenly stops mid-boast. "Wait... is that... Okurak, Pamykos, Pyre, and some new friends? Oh thank the gods, it's you! Please, I'm rather trapped at the moment! I created a spell to protect me from wild magic as i'm always misplacing my vortex ring, but i forgot to say one of the key words!"

**The Scene — Void Sphere Prison:**
- The sphere is about 10 feet in diameter, completely opaque from the outside but transparent from within
- Around the sphere, similar to what you remember from your previous encounter are a collection of strange transmuted objects including:
 - A turtle shell in the shape of a trombone
 - A bag with a large moustache and what look like eyes that keep winking at you as you speak
 - A 12ft toenail
 - A bubbling green candle with nostrils and wick that look like a tangle of large nostril hairs
 - A chair with 16 fingers for legs and a large hole where the seat should be
- Inside the sphere, Stinston (still in parrot form) is wrapped by writhing shadow tendrils that belong to an ancient looking creature of pure despair that feeds on life energy
- The wraith cannot be attacked directly while the sphere exists, and Stinston cannot escape

**Stinston's Explanation:**
"I was continuing my experiments and investigations into why the barriers between dimensions are weakening when I accidentally triggered a teeny tiny rupture causing this void wraith to emerged. It trapped me in here and has been slowly draining my magical essence. The sphere protects it from outside interference, but there should be a way to collapse it!"

**Finding the Dispel Focus:**
- Investigation DC 18 (group can assist) to find Stinston's **Void Anchor**—a crystalline focus among the transmuted debris that maintains the sphere
- The Void Anchor appears as a dark crystal that pulses with the same rhythm as the sphere
- It's currently embedded in what used to be a lectern (now shaped like a pretzel)

**Collapsing the Void Sphere (Skill Challenge):**
- The party must work together to overload the Void Anchor and collapse the sphere
- Primary check: Arcana DC 25 to understand the void magic patterns and safely overload the anchor
- Supporting checks (up to 4 can assist):
  - Religion DC 22: Channel divine energy to weaken the wraith's hold
  - Investigation DC 20: Find the optimal discharge points on the anchor
  - Athletics DC 18: Physically manipulate the twisted lectern to expose the crystal
  - Insight DC 20: Understand the wraith's connection to predict its reactions
- Each failed attempt triggers a **Greater Void Lash**: random party member makes Con save DC 20 or suffer one effect (d10):
  1-2) Transmorphed for 2 minutes into harmless creature (as before)
  3-4) Drained of spell slot (highest available)
  5-6) Take 3d8 necrotic damage and lose 1 divine ability use
  7-8) Stunned until end of next turn as reality fractures around them
  9-10) Temporarily banished to void space for 1 round (can't act but can observe)
  Taking 30+ damage in a round grants an extra save at end of that turn.

**Success:**
- The Void Anchor overloads with crackling energy, and the sphere suddenly implodes with a soft *pop*
- Stinston tumbles free as the wraith dissolves with an anguished wail, its tendrils releasing him
- The pretzel-lectern reverts to its normal shape, and several other transmuted objects return to their original forms
- "Ah, much better! Thank you, my friends. I learned quite a bit about void magic before that thing trapped me—knowledge that might prove useful against Fazrahl."

**Failure (4+ failed attempts):**
- The sphere destabilizes but doesn't collapse; instead it begins to expand rapidly
- All creatures within 50 ft must make Dex save DC 22 or be caught in the expanding void field, taking 4d8 necrotic damage and be stunned for 1 round
- The challenge can still be completed, but the Greater Void Wraith breaks free and must be fought alongside completing the ritual

**Rewards/Boons:**
- **Void Anchor Crystal** (rare wondrous): A dark crystal that pulses with contained void energy. Once per long rest, you can activate it to create a 10-foot radius sphere of magical silence for 1 minute. Spells cannot be cast into, out of, or within the sphere.
- **Stinston's Void Research:** Knowledge about Fazrahl's power source. The party gains insight that Fazrahl draws strength from despair and hopelessness—attacks made with genuine hope or joy deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage against him.
- **Sentinel Bypass Token:** Stinston gives the party a crystalline key that resonates with void energy. "This should let you past those stone guardians—they're powered by the same void magic I was studying. They'll recognize this as a master key and stand aside."
- **Sanctuary Pocket:** Stinston creates a stable dimensional pocket nearby. "This void tear taught me to create stable spaces. You can rest here safely—time moves differently, and Fazrahl cannot detect or reach you within." (Functions as a safe long rest location immune to scrying or attack)

----------------------
LAST SESSION

- **Void Conversion Amulets (2 amulets):** Stinston pulls two shimmering amulets from his dimensional research, each containing a void energy matrix. "I noticed you're missing your healer friend. These experimental pieces harness void magic's inverse properties—they can transform destructive energy into restorative power. Careful though, they're still prototypes!"
**Void Conversion Amulet** (rare wondrous):
- **Void Conversion:** As a bonus action, you can toggle the amulet's polarity. When active, all damage you deal is converted to healing and vice versa until it is turned off. The amulet remains in this mode until you toggle it again (bonus action) or until you take a short rest. Resistances or immunities to the damage types has no effect on the healing.
- **Void Resonance:** While the amulet is in healing mode you have disadvantage on saving throws against necrotic effects, as the void energy within resonates with his power.

**Stinston's Guidance:**
- "The void magic taught me much about this realm. The creatures here feed on despair, but they're weakened by genuine connection between allies. Stay close, trust each other, and remember what you're fighting for."
- He offers to cast a protective ward on the party: advantage on the next saving throw each character makes against fear or despair effects.

**Transition:**
Stinston flutters up to perch on the restored lectern, adjusting his tiny spectacles. "I'll continue my research here—this void tear has given me great insights into void magic. Go, my friends. That tower ahead pulses with the same dark energy I was studying. And take this—" He hands over the crystalline key. "The stone guardians should let you pass. No need for unnecessary battles when the real fight awaits within."

### Encounter 3: The Gloom Sentinels (Optional Combat)
Four massive stone guardians animate as the party approaches the tower. Their eyes glow with the only bright color visible - a sickly green.

**If the party has Stinston's Sentinel Bypass Token:**
The guardians' eyes flicker as they sense the crystalline key. They step aside with grinding stone movements, creating a clear path to the tower entrance. No combat necessary.

**If the party must fight (without the token):**

**Primordial Stone Colossi (6 Colossi):**
- **AC:** 28 **HP:** 1500 **Speed:** 50 ft., burrow 60 ft., climb 50 ft.
- **STR:** 30 **DEX:** 14 **CON:** 30 **INT:** 12 **WIS:** 20 **CHA:** 16
- **Saving Throws:** Str +20, Con +20, Wis +15
- **Damage Resistances:** All damage except Thunder, Force, and Radiant
- **Damage Immunities:** Poison, Psychic, Necrotic, Cold
- **Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Poisoned, Stunned, Paralyzed

- **Earth Phase:** Burrows underground, becoming untargetable. Can emerge anywhere within 120 feet on next turn, making all attacks with advantage and creating 20-foot radius difficult terrain.
- **Cataclysmic Pulse (Recharge 3-6):** 120-foot radius. DC 28 Constitution save or take 8d10 bludgeoning damage, be knocked prone, and gain 2 levels of exhaustion. Success: half damage, not prone, 1 level exhaustion.
- **Stone Prison (Recharge 4-6):** 40-foot radius around colossus. DC 28 Dex save or be restrained by stone pillars (AC 25, 100 HP each). Restrained creatures take 4d8 bludgeoning damage at start of each turn and cannot use legendary actions.
- **Primordial Regeneration:** Regains 50 HP at start of turn unless hit by thunder, force, or radiant damage that round. If reduced to 0 HP, explodes for 10d6 force damage in 60-foot radius (DC 28 Dex save for half).

**Legendary Actions (4 per turn):**
- Move up to speed without provoking opportunity attacks
- One slam attack
- Earth Phase (costs 2 actions)
- Cataclysmic Pulse (costs 3 actions)

**Tactical Elements:**
- Much higher AC and HP to match party power level
- Multiple attack types create complex battlefield control
- Legendary actions keep pressure on powerful party
- Vulnerability to specific damage types gives strategic options

## The Tower Approach

### The Obsidian Spire
As the party approaches Fazrahl's tower, the massive obsidian structure looms before them like a black needle piercing the gray sky. The very air around it seems to pulse with malevolent energy, and whispers of despair drift on the wind.

### Fazrahl's Taunts
As they draw near, Fazrahl's voice echoes across the wastes, seeming to come from the tower itself:
"I sense you are more resilient than I anticipated, but here, hope dies, color fades, and even your precious divine sparks will be snuffed out. You came so far, sacrificed so much... only to fail at the final moment. How... poetic. Those Archfiend Despair Lords you struggled against were but fragments—splinters of my will cast into the wastes. If echoes of my despair nearly broke you, imagine what awaits when you face the source."

### Tower Defenses
- A swirling barrier of shadow vines wraps around the base of the tower
- The vines grab and constrict, dealing 1d8 necrotic damage per round to grappled creatures
- **Shadow Vine Barrier:** AC 15, HP 120, vulnerable to radiant damage
- Successfully destroying the barrier reveals the tower entrance
- The vines regenerate 10 HP per round unless hit with radiant damage that round

## The Final Battle Chamber

The interior of the tower is a vast circular chamber with a domed ceiling that shows swirling galaxies of gray stars. In the center stands Fazrahl, but he appears... even darker and more powerful than before, and shadows writhe around him like living things.
- T Sound arrives a heartbeat late from the far wall.
- A continuous ring of basalt pillars lines the outer 30 feet of the arena: each pillar is roughly 10 ft thick, spaced about 30 ft apart, and rises to the ceiling. These pillars (and the shallow alcoves between them) provide total cover against line‑of‑sight effects; creatures fully behind a pillar are unaffected by Phase 3's blinding nova.
- Broken statues and fractured plinths near the perimeter form additional half‑to‑three‑quarters cover; moving between pillar alcoves typically costs 10 ft of movement.

- The chamber is stretches impossibly wide, far larger than its exterior suggests, and the ceiling climbs endlessly into a star‑lit void.
- A colonnade of black basalt pillars circles the outer 30 feet. Each pillar looks around 10 feet thick, spaced roughly 30 feet apart, and rise into the void above. Shallow alcoves lie between the pillars—wide enough for a person to slip into.
- Fallen statues and fractured plinths scatter the area, remnants you gather were left over from the previous inhabitants.

**Fazrahl's Opening Monologue:**
"Ah, my old friends, I am "happy" that you endured to gaze upon what I have become! No longer bound by the pathetic mortality that once shackled me. I have transcended your precious light, your naive justice. I am entropy itself! I am the end of hope!"

## The Aftermath

### Fazrahl's Final Words
As he dissolves, the former paladin's voice becomes clear one last time:
"I... I remember the light... What have I done? Pelor... forgive me..."

### The Survivors

**Stinston Stallone:** The parrot wizard appears one last time, no longer compulsively repeating (his transformation is slowly reversing): "The planar barriers are stabilizing! STABILIZING! *stabil--* Oh, thank goodness that's stopping. The convergence points are sealing themselves now that Fazrahl's influence is gone."

### Restoring the Dawn
- Pelor's stolen essence is freed and begins to return to its rightful place
- The Gray Wastes start to regain some color
- Dawn begins to break across the material plane for the first time in months
- The Charm of Echoing Hope glows brightly as despair lifts from the realm

### The Heroes' Choice
The party is offered a choice by the returning divine powers:
1. Ascend to full godhood and join the celestial pantheon
2. Return to the material plane as demigods to help rebuild
3. Sacrifice their divine power to ensure the material plane's protection

### Epilogue Notes
- **The Wizard's Research:** Stinston Stallone's studies of planar convergence help prevent future catastrophic magical accidents

---

## Potential Loot/Rewards
- **Kavan'Turok** (broken but repairable into a powerful artifact)
- **Essence of the Dawnfather** (can be used to create powerful magic items)
- **Fazrahl's Redemption** (a holy symbol that can turn undead permanently)
- **Memories of Light** (restored knowledge/spells from before the corruption)

---

## XP and Level Progression
- This should be enough to reach level 18 or potentially 19
- The final phase should award bonus XP for creative problem-solving
- Additional rewards for maintaining character bonds throughout the battle
