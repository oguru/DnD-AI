# Fazrahl Fight Rebalanced - 4 Players (High Damage)

## Phase 1: The Fallen Herald Returns (Time Stop Opener)

**Fazrahl's Entrance:** The fallen herald descends with measured purpose, eyes like cold suns. He fights much as before—precise battlefield control into brutal melee—but now his stolen divinity sharpens every edge.

"So you have come for a second chance? Then let us replay our previous encounter, and let's see whether you are worthy to face my full power"

### Fazrahl (Empowered Herald) Stats:
- **AC:** 26  **HP:** 1000  **Speed:** 60 ft., fly 60 ft.
- **STR:** 24  **DEX:** 20  **CON:** 24  **INT:** 22  **WIS:** 24  **CHA:** 26
- **Saving Throws:** Str +16, Dex +14, Con +16, Int +15, Wis +16, Cha +17
- **Damage Resistances:** psychic, fire, radiant, bludgeoning/piercing/slashing from nonmagical attacks
- **Damage Immunities:** necrotic
- **Condition Immunities:** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned
- **Senses:** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 24
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**

### Phase Intro – God-Voice of Dread
Before this phase begins, Fazrahl's voice manifests in three ways at once—booming from everywhere, as horrifying whispers, and inside each mind. All creatures in the chamber must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.

### Actions
- **Multiattack:** Fazrahl makes four attacks with his adaptive hand blades.
- **Adaptive Hand Blades:** Melee Weapon Attack: **+23 to hit**, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: **10d10 + 12** damage. On each attack, Fazrahl chooses the damage type: slashing, force, radiant, necrotic, cold, lightning, or thunder.
- **Crown of Stars (Bonus Action):** Ranged Spell Attack: **+23 to hit**, 120 ft., one target. Hit: 4d12 radiant damage. Seven motes orbit him until expended.
- **Spellcasting:** 20th-level caster (save **DC 25**, **+23 to hit**).
- At will: command, hellish rebuke. 
- 3/day each: fireball, hold person. 
- 2/day each: cone of cold (9d8, 60-ft cone), dispel magic. 
- 1/day each: Time Stop (5 rounds), Sunbeam, Symbol (Death), Contingency (Thunder Step; if a creature ends its turn within 10 ft., teleport and the creature takes 9d10 thunder, Con save for half).

### Time Stop Opener (example sequence)
- **Round 1:** Delayed Blast Fireball placed to catch multiple targets. Bonus: Misty Step to elevation. Positioning for advantage.
- **Round 2:** Prismatic Barrier (custom 60‑ft sphere variant of Prismatic Wall) encloses a zone or segments the field with layered resistances/effects.
- **Round 3:** Reposition and lay a Symbol or other control as needed.
- **Round 4:** Mirror Image. Bonus: Crown of Stars active (motes primed). Casts Meteor Swarm with a third Necrotic Meteor.
- **When time resumes:** The delayed blast detonates and the prismatic sphere warps the battlefield. Immediately after, two meteors crash down: **Meteor Swarm** (fire/bludgeoning as normal) and a second **Necrotic Meteor** (same areas; creatures make the same saves vs. necrotic instead of fire). Fazrahl then spends legendary actions to strike with his hand blades and a Crown of Stars mote, closing to finish in melee.

### Legendary Actions
- **Attack:** Make one hand blade attack.
- **Crown of Stars:** Make one mote attack.
- **Teleport:** Fazrahl teleports up to 60 ft.
- **Cast Spell (Costs 2):** Cast a spell that takes 1 action.
- **Soul Harvest (Costs 3):** If a creature has **99 HP or fewer**, it dies. Otherwise, it takes **10d10 necrotic** damage.

## Phase 2: The Void of Mirrors (Tendril Isolation)
**Fazrahl:** "Hahahaha, so you survived the onslaught this time? Interesting. Enough games though, now it is time for some self-reflection."

*All creatures must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.*

**Break and Isolate:** When Fazrahl is reduced to **450 HP** or at the end of **Round 5**, he unravels into shadowed tendrils that lance across the battlefield, plunging each hero into an isolated void. His body dissolves into writhing tendrils that streak along the floor, walls, and air. Each tendril spears into a hero's shadow and pulls them into a personal void.

Inside there is barely any light and all you can perceive before the blackness at it's boundary is a slight reflection. As you look, your reflection takes on a more sinister appearance and steps out of the boundary towards you.

### Mirror Mechanics
- Each player is isolated in their own 40-ft-radius void sphere where only they and a mirror-self exist.
- **Players MUST defeat their mirror to escape their void** - there is no quick or easy way out.
- When a player defeats their mirror, they re-emerge and can see the other voids as translucent spheres.
- Players can then step through the tendril-tears to enter another ally's void to help them fight their mirror.
- **All mirrors must be defeated for this phase to end.**

#### Mirror Stats (based on player characters)
- **AC/HP/Stats:** As the original character, but with 80% of their HP
- **Damage Type Conversion:** All damage they deal becomes necrotic
- **Radiant Vulnerability:** Vulnerable to radiant
- **Inversions:** Any healing ability becomes harm; immunity to being turned/banished
- **Defenses:** Match the original character's resistances and immunities exactly

---

## Phase 3: The Swarm Lord (Rounds 13-20)

As the last mirror is destroyed, the spheres dissolve back into tendrils black tendrils which coalesce and move back to where Fazrahl last was, reforming and knitting his previous form back together.

**Fazrahl:** "Your bodies are so fragile, so limited. Let me show you the manifestation of true power."

**Fazrahl's Metamorphosis:** With a ROAAAARR, Fazrahl's form explodes into a writhing, ever‑shifting swarm. The mass never settles—currents of chitin and void energy shear past one another, tendrils unfurl and recoil, and lesser eyes bloom and blink out across its surface. Among the multitude, **six great eyes** dominate, drifting within the mass and fixing their gaze upon you.

*All creatures must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.*

- **AC:** 28 **Speed:** 50 ft., climb 50 ft., burrow 30 ft.
- **HP:** 350 each; Eye of Radiance has 500  **Speed:** fly 80 ft. (hover)
- **Eye Reactions (1/round each):** Blink to negate damage.
- **When eye is destroyed:** Swarm loses corresponding attack option
- **STR:** 30 **DEX:** 16 **CON:** 28 **INT:** 20 **WIS:** 22 **CHA:** 26
- **Saving Throws:** Con +19, Wis +16, Cha +18, Int, +19, Str +12

- **Challenge Rating:** 26
- **Divine Penetration:** All attacks pierce 1 level of resistance.

### **CRITICAL MECHANIC - Swarm Body:**
- **The main body has NO HP and takes NO damage**
- **Only attacks against the floating eyes deal damage**
- **Eyes are the only way to meaningfully damage this form**
- **All 6 eyes must be destroyed to end this phase**

**Unique Eyes and Attacks (each eye uses only its own attack):**
- **Eye of Thunder — Thunderous Clap (1 eye):** 80-foot cone. DC 25 Con save or 10d10 thunder damage + knocked prone + deafened 1 minute (half damage, not prone/deafened on success).
- **Eye of Gravity — Gravitic Crush (1 eye):** Creates a 60‑ft‑radius singularity at a point within 120 ft, pulling all creatures 20 ft toward the center before resolving. Area becomes difficult terrain until the start of Fazrahl’s next turn. **DC 23 Strength save:** on fail, take 10d10 force damage and become restrained until end of next turn; on success, half damage and not restrained.

- **Eye of Dominion — Ravage Divinity (1 eye):** Fazrahl declares, "I shall take your divinity." Target makes a **DC 23 Intelligence save** (as with God‑Voice). On fail: takes 20d10 necrotic damage, is frightened until end of next turn (half and no frighten on success), and **can’t use divine powers** (class features, divine boons, healing/reality boons) until Fazrahl’s next attack resolves. **Fazrahl’s next attack is empowered:** +10d10 force damage, made with advantage (or +2 DC if a saving throw).

- **Eye of Madness — Psychic Reverence (1 eye):** All creatures who can see Fazrahl must make a **DC 23 Wisdom save**. On fail: take 12d6 psychic damage and must immediately use all movement to approach Fazrahl, then fall prone in worship—becoming both prone and stunned until damaged or until the end of their turn when they can repeat the save. On success: half damage, no conditions.

- **Eye of Plague — Virulent Miasma (1 eye):** 120‑ft cone. **DC 23 Constitution save:** on fail, take 6d8 poison and become diseased for 1 hour. Diseased creatures repeat the save at the end of each turn to end the effect. Success: half damage, not diseased.

- **Eye of Radiance — Blinding Nova (charge-up, 1 eye, recharge 2):** On the first turn, the eye glows and emits a keening sound (cannot use again until detonation). On the following turn: 150‑ft radius burst centered on the eye. **DC 25 Dexterity save:** on fail, 20d10 radiant damage and blinded for 1 minute (creatures behind total cover unaffected). Success: half damage, not blinded.

Per‑Eye Damage Immunities (eyes only):
- Eye of Thunder: Immune to thunder

- Eye of Dominion: Immune to necrotic
- Eye of Madness: Immune to psychic
- Eye of Plague: Immune to poison

- Each eye can only use its own unique attack; an eye cannot attack more than once per round.

**Swarm Body Actions (1-2 per round):**
- **Giant Hand Clap:** 80-foot cone. DC 25 Con save or 20d8 bludgeoning damage + stunned until end of next turn. Half on save. Moves all caught to the centre of the cone.
- **Razor Swarm:** The churning mass sheds blade‑like fragments in all directions; all creatures within 120 ft take **10d8 piercing** damage (no save).
- **Tendril Riptide:** 60-foot reach, +24 to hit, **20d10 + 10 necrotic** damage; on a hit the target is **grappled**.
- **Swarm Surge:** The body surges forward in a tearing wave (80‑ft cone). **DC 25 Dex** save or take **10d10 slashing** damage and be **pushed 10 ft** (on success, half damage and not pushed).
- **Corrupted Souls:** A swarm of horrific ghost‑like entities pour out of Fazrahl's body and attack:

### Abyssal Corrupted Souls (8 per group):
- **AC:** 23 **HP:** 120 **Speed:** 60 ft., climb 60 ft., fly 60 ft.

---

## Phase 4: The Chaos Lord (Final Phase)
**Fazrahl:** "Form is a comfort for the weak. I am unbound—will and ruin incarnate."

*All creatures must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.*

**Fazrahl's Final Form:** ...and the swarm collapses into a writhing mass of unstable raw energy and matter that defies comprehension. At its core you get brief glimpses of a divine light that appears to be constrained. This thing before you appears as a living contradiction: 
beautiful and hideous, divine and profane, creation and destruction 
merged into one impossible being.

### Fazrahl (Chaos Form) Stats:
- **AC:** 29 **HP:** 2000 **Speed:** 60 ft., fly 120 ft., teleport 120 ft.
- **STR:** 28 **DEX:** 24 **CON:** 28 **INT:** 26 **WIS:** 26 **CHA:** 30
- **Saving Throws:** Str +18, Dex +16, Con +18, Int +16, Wis +16, Cha +20
- **Damage Resistances:** All damage types except force
- **Damage Immunities:** Psychic, Necrotic; All conditions
- **Senses:** Truesight 120 ft., Blindsight 60 ft.
- **Divine Penetration:** All attacks pierce 1 level of resistance.

### **Lair Actions - Reality Flux:**
Each round, roll d6 for reality change (lasts until next flux):
1. **Gravity Shift:** All creatures must make DC 20 Dex save or fall prone
2. **Damage Conversion:** All damage becomes a single type for the round (roll d8)
3. **Spell Reflection:** All spells cast have a 50% chance to target the caster instead
4. **Arc Flash:** The first time each creature moves more than 10 feet on its turn, it takes 4d8 lightning damage (DC 20 Con save for half)
5. **Energy Inversion:** Healing becomes damage, damage becomes healing
6. **Annihilation Wake:** The first time each creature hits with an attack on its turn, the target erupts; all other creatures within 30 feet of the target take 6d8 force damage (no save)

**Actions (2-3x Formless Strike, 1 other):**
- **Formless Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: **+24 to hit**, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: **20d8 + 12** force damage. Fazrahl can shift his form to attack from any direction (ignores cover).
- **Essence Rapture (Recharge 3):** Fazrahl rips a victim's life‑thread free and wraps it around them. A creature within 120 ft must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** save or take **20d10 + 20 psychic** damage and become **restrained and silenced** until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half damage and suffers no conditions.
- **Fracture Reality (Recharge 3):** 60‑ft cone. **DC 20 Intelligence** save or take **10d10 radiant** damage and suffer **temporal displacement**: the creature's next turn is skipped, and when they next act, they are confused (as the spell) for 1 round. On success, half damage and no displacement.
- **Null Frost (Recharge 3):** Fazrahl births a sphere of absolute cold: a **50‑ft radius** zone within 120 ft that lasts until the start of his next turn. Creatures starting their turn in the sphere or entering it for the first time take **10d10 cold** damage (no save) and their speed is halved until the end of their turn. Ranged attacks and spells cannot pass through the sphere.
- **Disjunction Grasp (Recharge 3):** One creature within 10 ft. **DC 20 Constitution** save or take **12d10 acid** damage as form and gear unravel; until the end of its next turn, it suffers **−4 to AC and saving throws** (this penalty does not stack). On success, half damage and no penalty.
- **Essence Drain (2/Day):** All players must make a **DC 20 Con** save. On a fail, take **20d10 necrotic** damage and Fazrahl regains HP equal to the total damage dealt. On success, half damage and Fazrahl regains no HP.
- **Oblivion Surge (1/Fight):** Fazrahl unleashes a cataclysmic shockwave in a **150‑ft radius**. All creatures make a **DC 22 Dex** save or take **30d10 + 10 thunder** damage and are knocked prone and pushed **20 ft** away from Fazrahl. On success, half damage and no additional effects. After using this, Fazrahl cannot use legendary actions until the end of his next turn.

**Legendary Actions (3 per turn):**
- **Phase Shift:** Move or teleport up to 60 ft without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Lash of Entropy:** Make one Formless Strike attack.
- **Reality Warp (Costs 2):** Roll a new **Reality Flux** result or choose one from the list; it replaces the current Flux until the next round. Alternatively, release a **20‑ft‑radius pulse** within 60 ft: creatures make **DC 20 Con** save or take **4d8 force** and be pushed **10 ft** away (half damage and no push on success).

#### Battlefield Feature — Core of Dawn (Phase 4 only)
Within Fazrahl’s chest, the stolen light pulses as a visible core. A creature within **10 ft of Fazrahl** can attempt the following once per character per fight:

- **Action — Supplicate the Core (risky heal):** Make an unarmed attack (20AC) to plunge your hand in and draw a thread of radiance. On success, you regain **10d10 HP**, remove one of: blinded, frightened, charmed, stunned, poisoned, disease, or reduce exhaustion by 1, and gain **20 temporary HP** until the start of your next turn. This also builds **+1 Resonance**. On failure, you take **6d10 radiant** damage and are **blinded** until the end of your next turn; Fazrahl has **advantage** on attacks against you until then. This cannot be attempted while incapacitated.

### **The Turning Point - Pelor's Call**
When Fazrahl is reduced to **1000 HP or below**, the divine light trapped at his core erupts in a silent flare. There is no voice—only a surge of holy memory and instinct that floods the heroes with purpose. Images flash: a sun sundered, three anchors closing like a seal, and darkness split by radiance. Each hero feels the same wordless imperatives pressed into their minds: **stand together, stabilize reality, bind the thief, free the light.**

The party understands they must weaken Fazrahl's grip on the stolen divinity and free Pelor's essence to end this fight.

### **Ending the Fight - Liberation of Pelor:**

**Phase A: Building the Seal (reach 6 Resonance)**
From this point on, certain deeds cause the imprisoned light to answer. The heroes feel it as a gathering hum under the skin, a bright pressure behind the eyes, a warmth at the heart. Do not call it out—simply describe the sensations whenever one of the following occurs. Track an unseen counter called **Resonance**; when it reaches **6**, proceed to Phase B. A maximum of **2 Resonance** can accrue per round.

Catalysts that build Resonance:
- **+1** when a PC deals **radiant damage** to Fazrahl, a brief flare ripples through the chamber as if a chain link loosens.
- **+1** when a PC bears a **Void Conversion Amulet** (see Session 11) and ends their turn with the amulet in healing mode after having dealt damage that round, a harmonic aftershock turns pain to warmth and the light steadies.
- **+1** when a PC succeeds on a **Reality Flux** save, the flux stutters and the light steadies for a heartbeat.
- **+1** when the party ends a round with all members within **30 ft** of each other, a resonant circle forms and the hum deepens.
- **+1** when a PC uses a **bonus action (or replaces one weapon attack)** to **Harmonize the Seal** (DC 20 Arcana/Religion/Insight): on a success, they weave a strand of order into the chaos (builds Resonance) and gain a minor boon until the start of their next turn: **+2 to saves**. On a failure, a radiant backlash deals **4d6 radiant** and grants **advantage on that PC’s next Harmonize** attempt this fight.

Harmonize the Seal (clarifications):
- A creature can attempt Harmonize once per turn.
- An adjacent ally can Assist as a bonus action to grant **+5** to the check (no roll required).
- Creatures concentrating on the Trinity Seal may also Harmonize as a bonus action without risking their concentration.

**Discovery Checks (optional, any time):**
- **Identify Catalysts (Arcana/Religion/Insight DC 18):** Learn one specific catalyst from the list above that will feed the light this round (DM chooses or rolls). On DC 22+, learn two.
- **Sense Threshold (Perception/Insight DC 15):** The party gauges how close the hum feels: "just begun," "building," "nearly complete" (low/medium/high Resonance).

**Phase B: Form the Trinity Seal (when Resonance = 6)**
Once 6 Resonance is achieved, Pelor's light pulses and three golden anchor points appear on the battlefield, forming a **triangle** around Fazrahl (at least 40 ft apart). The party has **2 rounds** to complete the seal:

1. **Plant Anchors:** Three different PCs must each use an **action** to plant/attune an anchor (DC 20 Arcana/Religion/Athletics). On a failure, take **4d6 radiant** backlash and the anchor is not planted. An anchor can be re-attempted.

2. **Channel the Seal:** Once all 3 anchors are planted, one PC must stand at an anchor and use their **action to concentrate** (maintaining concentration as if on a spell).
   - Each time the channeling PC takes damage: **DC 15 Con save** to maintain (allies in the triangle can use **reaction** to grant **+2** to a failed save)
   - At the **end of the channeling PC's next turn** (if concentration held): The seal completes

**Phase C: Liberation (when seal completes)**
You see the three anchors ignite and lines of gold snap tight around Fazrahl. A silent sunrise bursts from within him—light spears upward, and shadow peels away like smoke. Thousands of tiny motes pour out—faces, hands, brief smiles—as the bound souls streak free and vanish through the ceiling of the tower.

Fazrahl fractures with hairline seams of daylight, then explodes into drifting ash and black glass. The last shard of stolen light rips skyward and is gone.

A blinding flash washes the chamber white. For the barest heartbeat you see something vast and ordered—circles within circles, law written in light—and then as quickly as it appeared it is replaced by an **old man wearing a robe and radiating wisdom** who stands before you. 

Effects:
- Fazrahl is **destroyed**: reduce him to 0 HP and he **disintegrates**. He cannot act again or be revived by any means short of a greater deity’s direct intervention.
- All captured souls are **released** and depart harmlessly through the chamber.
- Reality stabilizes—all Reality Flux effects end permanently.

**If concentration breaks:** All anchors flicker out. The party takes **6d6 force** damage. Resonance drops to **3** and they must build it back to 6 to try again.

## Backup NPC: Yrsa, Champion of Tyr

If the party is struggling severely (multiple members down with no resurrection available), Yrsa will appear as a divine intervention. She has the following simplified stat block for quick play:

### Yrsa (Divine Champion)
- **AC:** 28 **HP:** 550
- **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 20 ft.
- **Key Abilities:** 
  - **Divine Aura:** Allies within 10 ft gain 70 temp HP at the start of her turn
  - **Healing Focus:** All healing spells cast at 3x effectiveness
  - **Combat:** +12 to hit, 54 damage per hit (27 bludgeoning, 27 radiant)

**Key Actions:**
- **Mass Cure Wounds (1/Day):** Heal up to 6 creatures for 54 HP each
- **Sanctuary Aura (1/Day):** 20-ft radius sphere, allies gain resistance to all damage and advantage on saves for 1 minute
- **Tyr's Justice (1/Day):** 30-ft radius, 63 radiant damage and blind enemies (DC 22 Cha save for half damage, no blind)

**Tactics:** Yrsa will focus primarily on healing and support, using her Divine Aura to provide temporary HP while using her action to heal fallen party members. She'll only attack if all party members are stable.

---

## Adjusted Environmental Effects

To make the battlefield more dynamic and provide tactical options for 4 players:

1. **Healing Fonts:** 3-4 glowing pools appear around the battlefield that can be used to heal 6d10 HP once per character

2. **Divine Anchors:** Pillars that players can attune to (bonus action) to gain resistance to one damage type for 1 minute

3. **Reality Tears:** Areas where players can briefly step through (action) to avoid AoE effects or reposition

4. **Hope Crystals:** Destructible objects that, when shattered, create a 15-ft radius zone where all healing is doubled for 1 round

These environmental features give the smaller party more tactical options to compensate for fewer actions per round.

## Damage Comparison with Archfiend Despair Lords

### Archfiend Despair Lord Attacks:
- Soul Rend: 10d10 + 10 necrotic damage (4 attacks per round) = 4 × (55+10) = 260 damage per round
- Despair Nova: 12d8 poison damage (avg 54) + stunned for 2 rounds
- Sacrificial Pact: 50d8 + 20 psychic damage (avg 245) to all targets

### Fazrahl (Shadow Form) Attacks:
- Shadow Bolt: 12d10 + 20 necrotic + 6d6 psychic (avg 92) × 4 = 368 damage per round
- Shadow Storm: 18d8 necrotic damage (avg 81) + blinded
- Abyssal Sacrifice: 25d8 + 30 psychic damage (avg 142.5) to all targets + stunned

### Fazrahl (Final Form) Attacks:
- Omnislash: 25d10 + 30 damage of each: slashing, force, psychic, necrotic (avg 567.5 total) to all targets
- Cosmic Annihilation: 30d10 + 50 damage (avg 215) to all targets + stunned

This revised version ensures Fazrahl's damage output meets or exceeds the Archfiend Despair Lords, making him a truly terrifying final boss worthy of the campaign's climax.
