# The Path to the Celestial Realms

## Awakening to Divine Purpose

### Jizz'rek's Gift
- The party awakens with new life, divine essence coursing through their veins
- **Divine Awakening (Level 1)**: Each member receives Jizz'rek's initial blessing, manifesting as:
  - Enhanced physical capabilities
  - Divine resilience against certain damage types
  - Empowered attacks and abilities
  - Connection to celestial energies
- A shared vision reveals Fazrahl absorbing Pelor's divine essence before descending to the infernal planes
- Jizz'rek's voice echoes: *"You must rise above mortality to face what comes. Seek the celestial realms for guidance."*

### Ascending to the Divine Spires
- **Celestial Pathways**: The party's new divine essence allows them to perceive hidden celestial pathways
- **Points of Access**:
  - Ancient temples with faded celestial sigils
  - Places where the veil between realms is naturally thin
  - Sites of great spiritual significance untouched by Fazrahl's corruption
- A simple ritual using their combined divine power can open a temporary passage to the lower celestial realm

## The Cosmic Crisis

### Audience with Celestial Authority
- Upon reaching the Divine Spires, the party is greeted by **Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon** or another appropriate deity
- The god recognizes the divine spark within them: *"Jizz'rek's essence flows through you, a bold gambit indeed. Few mortals could contain such power without being consumed."*
- The deity explains the current state of divine affairs and why direct intervention is impossible

### Ao's Absence
The Overgod's attention is currently focused on a critical task that prevents his direct intervention:
- Creating new planes to maintain cosmic balance after several were destroyed in an ancient catastrophe
- Containing a breach in the fundamental fabric of reality that threatens all existence
- Mediating a conflict between primordial forces that could unravel creation itself

This absence has created a window of opportunity for Fazrahl's ambitions.

### The Divine Compact
- The deity explains: *"Even now, we cannot directly intervene. The compact that binds us is absoluteâ€”to break it would risk destabilizing what remains of cosmic order."*
- However, they recognize the party's unique position: *"But you stand outside our restrictions. Mortal, yet touched by divinity. Neither bound by our limitations nor constrained by mortal frailty."*
- The god offers a path forward: *"Your divine essence can be strengthened, awakened further through trials that prove your worthiness."*

## The Three Divine Trials

### The Path to Power
- The deity outlines three trials that will strengthen the party's divine connection:
  - *"Each trial completed will deepen your connection to divinity"*
  - *"With each blessing, your power will grow beyond mortal limits"*
  - *"Complete all three, and you may stand a chance against Fazrahl"*

### Trial 1: Liberation of Athkatla
- **Divine Objective**: Reclaim the city from Fazrahl's followers and destroy his temples
- **Sacred Purpose**: By dismantling Fazrahl's power base, his connection to the mortal plane weakens
- **Key Challenge**: Defeat Fazrahl's lieutenant, Okurak's mother, who oversees the city's corruption
- **Divine Reward**: Upon completion, the party will receive a greater blessing, achieving **Divine Level 2**
- *"Cleanse the city of this corruption. Each prayer to Fazrahl strengthens him. Each temple feeds his ambition."*

### Trial 2: Sealing the Infernal Breach
- **Divine Objective**: Close the portal Fazrahl opens to unleash demons upon the Sword Coast
- **Sacred Purpose**: Preventing demonic incursion preserves the balance between planes, and reduces Fazrahl's power further which stems from changing the balance of the realms
- **Key Challenge**: Battle waves of demons before confronting Moryx the Doombringer
- **Divine Reward**: Success earns the final blessing, reaching **Divine Level 3**
- *"The barriers between planes weaken under Fazrahl's assault. Stem this tide of chaos before it consumes all."*

### Trial 3: The Celestial Ascent
- **Divine Objective**: Return to the celestial realms with newfound power to receive final guidance
- **Sacred Purpose**: Complete celestial attunement before facing Fazrahl
- **Key Challenge**: Navigate the increasingly dangerous celestial pathways
- **Divine Reward**: Activation of all divine abilities and knowledge of Fazrahl's vulnerabilities
- *"Return here once your divine essence has fully awakened. Only then can I reveal how you might triumph."*

## The State of the Celestial Realms

### The Three Tiers
1. **The Blessed Fields** - Lower celestial realm, home to lesser celestials and petitioners
2. **The Divine Spires** - Middle realm where good-aligned gods traditionally reside
3. **The Dark Coronet** - Newly revealed upper realm where evil-aligned gods dwell, previously hidden by divine magic

*Fazrahl's actions have exposed The Dark Coronet, disrupting the ancient balance of power.*

### Current Situation
- Good-aligned gods are fortifying The Divine Spires
- Evil gods are emerging from The Dark Coronet, sensing opportunity
- Lesser celestials are being corrupted or fleeing to mortal planes
- Divine barriers between realms are weakening

## DM Notes
- Start the party with Divine Level 1 powers as soon as they're revived by Jizz'rek
- The divine powers should make players feel significantly stronger but not invincible
- Each trial should provide clear indications of their growing power
- Keep progression focused with minimal side quests to maintain momentum
- Allow for meaningful character moments, especially with NPC allies
- Consider how Okurak will react to confronting his mother
- Prepare for the party to potentially deviate from the expected path
