# Celestial Realm Visit

## Arrival and Guardian Encounter

### The Ascent
- Party uses their divine awareness to locate a celestial pathway
- Possible locations: ancient temple, mountaintop, or place where the veil is thin
- As they focus their divine energy, a shimmering portal opens
- Stepping through reveals:
  - Endless expanse of stars and cosmic energy
  - Path of solidified light stretching upward
  - Distant structures of impossible beauty

### The Guardian Confrontation

**Guardian Appearance:**
- Massive angelic figure (20 feet tall)
- Four wings of pure light
- Armor that seems made of condensed starlight
- Wielding a spear of radiant energy

**Initial Confrontation:**
- Guardian bars the path: *"Halt! You dare enter the celestial realm, mortals?!"*
- Raises spear threateningly: *"The upper planes are not for your kind to tread!"*
- If party explains their situation:
  - Guardian becomes curious, lowers weapon
  - *"I sense... divine essence within you. Yet you remain mortal. How curious."*
- If party mentions Jizz'rek and/or Fazrahl:
  - Guardian's demeanor changes completely
  - *"Fazrael? The fallen herald? And you bear the essence of Jizz'rek?"*
  - *"This matter requires higher consultation. You will wait while I speak with the elders."*

## The Waiting Area

### The Chamber of Reflection

**Setting:**
- Circular chamber with walls of living crystal
- Floor inscribed with the history of the multiverse
- Floating seats of cloud-like material
- Windows looking out onto impossible cosmic landscapes

**Possible Interactions:**

1. **Memory Pools**
   - Shimmering pools of liquid light in alcoves
   - Looking into them shows memories from the viewer's past
   - Can be used to reflect on their journey so far
   - Potential prompt: *"What moment brought you to this path?"*

2. **Lesser Celestial Attendant**
   - Young angel or celestial being curious about mortals
   - Asks questions about the material plane
   - Shares rumors about Fazrahl's actions and Pelor's fall
   - *"Is it true mortals must eat every day? How tedious!"*
   - *"The higher spheres are in chaos since Pelor fell. None thought it possible."*

3. **Cosmic Window**
   - One window shows Athkatla from above
   - Corrupted leylines visible as dark veins through the land
   - Shows Fazrahl's followers strengthening their hold
   - Potential prompt: *"What you see is happening now - Fazrahl's corruption spreads."*

### Guardian's Return

- Guardian returns after the party has had time to explore
- Appears more respectful now: *"The elders has deliberated. You are to be granted audience."*
- Explains key points:
  - *"The gods are forbidden from direct interference by divine compact."*
  - *"But you exist in a unique state - part mortal, part divine."*
  - *"This means you may act where they cannot."*
  - *"You must choose which deity to receive further blessing from. Tyr The Lord of Justice, Gond The Lord of All Smiths, Mystra The Lady of Mysteries, Helm The Vigilant One and Eldath Mother Guardian of Groves have agreed to speak with you, choose wisely."*

## The State of the Celestial Realms

### The Three Tiers
1. **The Blessed Fields** - Lower celestial realm, home to lesser celestials and petitioners
2. **The Divine Spires** - Middle realm where good-aligned gods traditionally reside
3. **The Dark Coronet** - Newly revealed upper realm where evil-aligned gods dwell, previously hidden by divine magic

*Fazrahl's actions have exposed The Dark Coronet, disrupting the ancient balance of power.*

### Current Situation
- Good-aligned gods are fortifying The Divine Spires
- Evil gods are emerging from The Dark Coronet, sensing opportunity
- Lesser celestials are being corrupted or fleeing to mortal planes
- Divine barriers between realms are weakening

## Meeting the Chosen Deity

### Approaching the Divine

- Guardian leads party down a hallway of increasingly intense light
- Pathway shifts to match the domain of the deity they've chosen
- Entering a chamber that defies mortal comprehension
- Deity waits on a simple throne, power restrained for mortal interaction

### The Divine Conversation

**Opening from Deity:**
- Acknowledgment of their divine spark: *"I see Jizz'rek chose well. His essence grows within you."*
- Explanation of the crisis:
  - *"Fazrahl has done what was thought impossible - slain a god and stolen their essence."*
  - *"The cosmos trembles at this violation. The balance is undone."*
  - *"We gods are bound by ancient compacts not to interfere directly."*
  - *"Your existence bridges mortal and divine - a loophole in cosmic law."*

**Ao's Absence:**
The deity explains why the Overgod cannot intervene:
- *"Even Ao, the Overgod who oversees us all, cannot directly intervene at this time."*
- *"His attention is focused on a critical task that prevents his direct action:"*
  - *"He is creating new planes to maintain cosmic balance after several were destroyed in an ancient catastrophe."*
  - *"He must contain a breach in the fundamental fabric of reality that threatens all existence."*
  - *"He mediates a conflict between primordial forces that could unravel creation itself."*
- *"This absence has created the window of opportunity that Fazrahl has exploited."*

**The Challenge:**
- Deity explains they must grow stronger:
  - *"Your divine spark is but a candle beside Fazrahl's stolen sun."*
  - *"To face him, you must strengthen your divine essence."*
  - *"And to defeat him, you must weaken his power base."*

**The First Task:**
- Explanation of Athkatla's importance:
  - *"Athkatla has become a nexus of Fazrahl's power on the material plane."*
  - *"His high priestess has corrupted the city's ancient leylines."*
  - *"Every prayer to him there strengthens his divine ascension."*
  - *"The perversion of natural energies feeds his stolen divinity."*
- Clear objectives:
  - *"Reclaim the city from his followers."*
  - *"Destroy his temple and end his high priestess's corruption."*
  - *"Restore the natural flow of energy to the land using your combined divine power."*
  - *"Return to me when this is done, and your divine essence will grow."*

**Parting Words:**
- Blessing gesture: *"I grant you what aid I can without breaking the compact."*
- Warning: *"Be wary. Fazrahl senses threats to his power. He will respond."*
- Encouragement: *"What you do shapes the future of many realms. Go with purpose."*

## Return to the Material Plane

- Deity opens a portal directly to the outskirts of Athkatla
- Brief glimpse of the city: walls reinforced, dark energy swirling above temples
- Guardian's final words: *"Remember, mortal ones - you walk between worlds now. Neither fully divine nor merely mortal. That is your strength."*
- Party steps through, ready to begin their first divine trial
