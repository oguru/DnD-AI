# Retaking Athkatla: Divine Trial 1

## The Geography of Athkatla

### Peninsular Layout
- Athkatla sits on a peninsula jutting from the mainland
- Single land entrance with massive fortified gate at the neck of the peninsula
- Three sides exposed to sea with cliff walls 80-100 feet high
- Small harbor on the eastern side with heavily guarded docks
- Secret smuggler's caves accessible by small boats at high tide (known only to resistance)

### Key Locations and Defenses
1. **Main Gate** - Heavily fortified with 4 ballistae, elite cultists, and magical barriers
2. **Harbor District** - Patrolled by corrupted sea creatures and cultist ships
3. **Smuggler's Caves** - Hidden entrance, minimal guards but trapped
4. **Temple District** - Center of Fazrahl's power, multiple corruption nodes
5. **Government District** - Fallen celestials coordinate here, magical surveillance
6. **The Citadel** - Valeria's stronghold with direct connection to Fazrahl

## Allied Forces & Strategy Session

When meeting with allies, present these options and let the party decide:

### Allies Present at Strategy Meeting
- **Gideon** and his 20 elite paladins (level 12-15)
- **Okurak** with 30 werebear warriors
- **Amara Nightshade** representing the city resistance

### Strategic Options to Present

1. **Direct Assault** (Main Gate Attack)
   - **Approach**: Full frontal attack on the main gate
   - **Advantages**: Straightforward, allies can participate fully
   - **Disadvantages**: Heavily defended, ballistae will cause casualties
   - **Skill Checks**: Intimidation to rally troops, Athletics for breaching gates
   
2. **Sea Infiltration** (Small Boat Approach)
   - **Approach**: Small team approaches via smuggler's caves at high tide
   - **Advantages**: Bypasses main gate entirely, less guarded
   - **Disadvantages**: Limited reinforcements, dangerous sea creatures
   - **Skill Checks**: Stealth to avoid patrols, Athletics for climbing cliffs
   
3. **Harbor Assault** (Naval Attack)
   - **Approach**: Secure ships and attack the harbor directly
   - **Advantages**: Creates secondary front, divides enemy forces
   - **Disadvantages**: Need to secure ships, naval defenses
   - **Skill Checks**: Persuasion to secure vessels, Acrobatics for ship-to-dock movement

4. **Magical Breach** (Divine Transportation)
   - **Approach**: Use divine powers to teleport past defenses
   - **Advantages**: Bypass physical defenses entirely
   - **Disadvantages**: Likely to trigger magical alarms
   - **Skill Checks**: Arcana to identify ward weaknesses, Religion to counter divine barriers

### Planning Phase Mechanics
- Each character can contribute one skill check to the planning
- Success provides advantages during implementation
- Three or more successes grant a significant advantage (surprise round, disabled trap, etc.)
- Failures increase the difficulty of subsequent encounters

## DM Notes

### Attack Distribution Guidelines
- Distribute enemy attacks evenly among party members
- When a character uses AoE abilities, have more enemies target them next round
- When a character drops below 75 HP, intelligent enemies should shift focus to them

### Balancing On The Fly
- If party is struggling: Reduce enemy HP by 25%, remove legendary resistances
- If party is dominating: Add reinforcement waves, increase boss HP by 25%
- For Valeria battle: Adjust mythic threshold based on party resources
- Remember divine powers multiply damage by 1.5x and healing by 1.5x

### Ability Calculations
- Level 17 characters with divine powers will have approximately:
  - ~225-230 HP (100 base + CON + divine 1.5x multiplier)
  - +2 AC from divine powers
  - 1.5x damage output
  - Powerful legendary items adding another tier of power

### Tactical Notes
- Ballistae: +14 to hit, 5d10 piercing, 500ft range
- Anti-Magic Zones: Located near corrupted temples, 30ft radius
- Divine Traps: Various locations, 8d10 damage, DC 19 Dex save
