### Return to Athkatla

**Initial Emergence:**
"Your portal opens to a city transformed. Weeks seem to have passed, and Athkatla has become a nightmare reflection of itself. The air is thick with the stench of burning flesh - massive pyres outside the city walls consume endless piles of corpses, black smoke coiling into the sickly yellow sky.

The land itself has changed. All plant life has withered to black husks, and crimson tendrils - like bloated veins - snake across the scorched earth. A new path circles the city, the ground beneath it charred and pulsing with familiar dark energy, reminiscent of the ritual sites you witnessed in Verbobonc. It appears as though the leylines have been corrupted, their power twisted to serve darker purposes."

**City Approach:**
"The once-proud walls of Athkatla now loom like the bars of a prison. Between the corpse pyres, wretched figures shuffle about their grim work, adding more bodies to the flames. Above, carrion birds wheel in endless circles, their cries mixing with distant screams from within the city."

**Inside the Walls:**
"The streets have become a maze of desperation and depravity. Orc patrols march through the thoroughfares, their armor adorned with trophies from the fallen. Between them, wretches huddle in doorways or scramble for scraps.

At street corners, shifty merchants have set up impromptu stalls, hawking stolen goods from the dead - everything from family heirlooms to magical trinkets taken from fallen nobles. Their eyes hold a haunted look that suggests they've seen horrors that would break stronger souls."

### Okurak's Departure & Gideon's Return

**The Meeting:**
As you navigate the corrupted streets, two figures emerge from the shadows of a burned-out building - Ronar and, surprisingly, Gideon. The werebear's usual stoic demeanor is marked with urgency, and both men motion you quickly inside.

**Gideon** (Speaking in hushed tones):
"Oh thank Pelor you made it out! When I heard you'd returned... I almost couldn't believe it. Been having street children watch the gates, lighting signals when travelers arrive. After what happened in the prison..." *his voice trails off, then refocuses* "There's something you need to know about Fazrahl."

**The Prison Visit:**
"He came to my cell before the ritual. Just... walked in. The torches dimmed, and reality itself seemed to recoil from his presence. But underneath all that corruption, I saw something familiar - the bearing of a fallen paladin. The way he held himself, the practiced movements... he was once one of us, I'm certain of it."

"He spoke of Pelor with such... personal hatred. 'The Dawnfather will regret casting me aside,' he said.

Gideon stares off into the void as he remembered the encounter, and after a moment of heavy silence, Ronar steps forward, his expression grim. He turns to Okurak, his voice tight with concern.

**Ronar** (To Okurak, with grave urgency):
"Brother, I hate to add to our troubles, but there's worse news. The Dawn found our settlement. Your mother... she leads them now. All clans gather at the Ancient Hold. You know our laws - its location must remain sacred to our kind alone."

**The Departures:**
Okurak grips his holy symbol of Valkur. "The storm calls me to protect my clan. My path lies with them now."

"And I must reach my order," Gideon adds grimly. "I've sent messages, but heard nothing back. I have to warn them in person about what's coming, I will try to bring support."

With determined nods, they depart in different directions - Okurak and Ronar into the deep woods toward their hidden sanctuary, and Gideon toward the distant mountains where his order maintains their fortress. Both leave you amid the chaos of a burning Athkatla, each to gather forces for the battles to come.

### Approaching Highgarden

As you make your way toward Highgarden, the once-pristine district of Athkatla's elite now stands defaced with Dawn cult symbols, its elegant gardens withered to ash.

The central plaza has been transformed into a grotesque laboratory. The once beautiful fountain now serves as the base for Arfan's command platform - a construct of brass, crystal, and pulsing arcane tubes. Around it, acid vats bubble with partially dissolved bodies, while glass cylinders filled with blue-green fluid contain silhouettes of hybrid creatures.

Near the platform, several nobles kneel in chains, expressions vacant. Arfan stands above them, his once-pristine white coat now bearing Dawn emblems in crimson thread. A crooked crown of twisted metal and glowing crystals sits atop his wild hair.

He gestures wildly as he addresses the crowd; "Duke Arfan the Distinguished brings enlightenment! Duke Arfan the Deliberate brings progress! The old order failed you, but Duke Arfan the Daring succeeds where others faltered!"

Arfan's once-pristine white coat now bears Dawn emblems embroidered in crimson thread, and a crooked crown of twisted metal and glowing crystals sits atop his wild hair, which has grown longer and more frenzied.

As you observe from the edge of the plaza, Arfan's manic monologue suddenly stops and his head snaps in your direction. A twisted smile spreads across his face and his platform rises 30ft into the air, powered by 4 magical emitters.

(Pointing & cackling) - "Duke Arfan the Discerning sees all!" "The wanderers return! How fortuitous! Duke Arfan the Delighted welcomes new subjects for his greatest experiments!"

"Duke Arfan the Discerning sees all!" he cackles. "The wanderers return! How fortuitous!"

He slams his staff down, shattering the glass cylinders. Fluid cascades across the floor as hybrid creatures emerged - humanoid bodies grafted with mechanical parts and mutated limbs.

"Enhanced specimens, eliminate these disruptions to our glorious progress!"
and with that, the creatures advance

As Arfan falls, the staff's swirling orb of force dims and fades to a dull gray. The mechanical components lock into place, becoming rigid and lifeless. What was once a marvel of arcane engineering now appears as little more than an ornate walking stick of brass and crystal, though faint traces of residual magic still linger within its core.

**Quirk:**
Even in its dormant state, the staff occasionally creaks and shifts, as if remembering its former glory. As you hold it you feel a subtle urge to announce yourself with greater flair than usual.

Entry 83
Those meddlesome adventurers forced Duke Arfan the Diplomatic to postpone victory, but they've achieved NOTHING! The council replacements were already complete. Their petty "victory" merely interrupted a single experiment while our REAL work continues unhindered!

Entry 87
Our council infiltration succeeded PERFECTLY! Potraya's High Council position vetoes security concerns. Vishalu redirects guard patrols away from our sites. Riga Quipple ensures our arcanite crystals arrive disguised as "festival decorations." The beautiful Olessa rewrote shipping regulations to allow continuous cult vessel access. With Thim, Tunny, and Manbridge's replacement also under our control, Duke Arfan the Discerning has positioned ALL pieces for the master's grand design!

Entry 96
The citywide festival strategy was BRILLIANT! None recognized the arcanite crystals as soul receptacles positioned at key leyline intersections. Duke Arfan the Detailed calculated we needed 43,752 souls minimum - festival attendance reached nearly 55,000! 

Entry 103
MAGNIFICENT SUCCESS! 54,631 souls extracted simultaneously when the ritual activated! Only a few weak wretches remain, but they are of no concern to us.
Lord Fazrahl journeys to Nessus for Kavan'Turok - the weapon that can momentarily disable ANY force and extract a god's essence directly into our arcanite.
Should the master not return... Duke Arfan the Devious will take up his rightful place as leader of the realms. The calculations suggest a 37% survival probability - acceptable risk for GODHOOD! Those self-righteous adventurers may return, but they'll find Duke Arfan the Devastating more than prepared!

### How to Use These Materials

Pyre can salvage these materials from Arfan's lab during or after the battle. Some might require careful extraction from damaged machines, while others could be found intact in storage areas or experimental chambers.

These materials can reduce crafting time by half for related gadgets and provide a +2 bonus to crafting checks. Additionally, gadgets created with these materials have unique properties reflecting their origin - they might whisper Arfan's proclamations when activated, display enhanced effects against Dawn cultists, or occasionally manifest small mechanical arms to assist the user.

### Paths to Nessus

1. **Madam Vex's Scroll**
   - Scroll of Plane Shift (7th level) - 500gp
   - Already available in Market of Dead
   - Safe but one-way trip (would need another scroll or method to return)

     - Blood sacrifice (1d6 damage to each user)
     - Corrupted arcane focus (can be salvaged from Arfan's lab)
   - Higher risk but creates a tethered connection allowing return within 24 hours

3. **The Dawn Ritual**
   - Captured Dawn cultist knows ritual to open portal
   - Requires 4 hours to perform
   - Uses cult symbols found throughout city
   - Advantage: Opens exactly where desired in Nessus
   - Disadvantage: Alerts denizens of Nessus to your arrival

4. **Prototype Planar Resonator**
   - Can be constructed using Arfan's components
   - DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana) check
