# The All-Father Ao

## The Brief Return
- The air stills, he lowers his hood and with power emanating from him, he opens his robes and Pelor's radiance pours into him and disappears without a trace. The figure inclines his head to you in acknowledgment.
- "The fractures have ceased their spreading. For the first time in eons, I am no longer needed to hold reality's seams together across infinite failing timelines."
- "I have returned because the cycle is broken. Eight hundred and forty-seven realities no longer scream in endless defeat. The temporal wounds heal."


## The Measure of Mortals
- His gaze pierces each of you, and in it race your entire lives—first breath to this breath—laid bare.
- "I see the line of your days across all timelines. What took eight hundred and forty-eight attempts to achieve, you have accomplished through something no previous iteration possessed."
- "You learned what power could not teach: that small kindnesses matter more than grand gestures, that unity born of difference is stronger than uniformity, that hope shared is hope multiplied."
- "You have been tested not just by me, but by the weight of 847 failed realities. You have been found worthy."

### The Weight of Infinity
- Ao gestures, and reality fractures around you. For a moment, you see glimpses of the 847 failed timelines—worlds where you fell, where darkness won, where hope died.
- **Each character makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14/18):**
  - **Success**: You gain profound insight into the patterns of failure and success. You understand how to prevent similar catastrophes in the future. (Gain a permanent +1/2 to Wisdom and advantage on the next major decision you make)
  - **Failure**: The weight of infinite suffering temporarily overwhelms you. You are stunned for 1 minute as you process the scope of what you've prevented. (But gain inspiration for overcoming this mental trial)

### The Mirror of Truth
- Ao conjures mirrors of starlight before each of you. In them, you see yourselves as you appeared in the worst timeline—corrupted, fallen, everything you swore never to become.
- **Each character makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 16):**
  - **Success**: You firmly reject this dark reflection and affirm your true nature. Your sense of self is strengthened. (Gain advantage on saves against charm, fear, and possession effects for the next year)
  - **Failure**: You're shaken by how close you came to that fate. (Disadvantage on the next major moral choice, but if you choose correctly despite this, gain double inspiration)

- "Your legend grows beyond a single timeline. I decree that you may remain as demigods, wardens and protectors of the mortal realms, should you will it."

## The Choice of the Dawn
- "One thread remains unbound: the dawn. The mantle of the Dawnfather lies wounded. If you desire, I will bless one among you with the Dawn's essence."
- "That soul will ascend to take Pelor's seat, rekindling first light and restoring the great order of day. The cost is real, the charge eternal."

### Shared Vision of the Dawn
- Ao extends his hand, and suddenly all of you experience what it would be like to bear the Dawn mantle.
- You feel the weight of every sunrise across infinite worlds, the responsibility for all light and growth, the eternal duty to kindle hope in darkness.
- **Each character makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 20):**
  - **Success**: You understand the full scope of the responsibility but feel you could bear it if needed. (If you choose to take the mantle, you gain additional benefits)
  - **Failure**: The overwhelming nature of eternal responsibility leaves you shaken. You understand why gods sometimes go mad from their duties.

### Divine Debate
- Ao steps back. "The choice is yours to make together. Speak freely—even gods must sometimes counsel with their peers."
- This is an opportunity for the party to discuss, debate, and even argue about who (if anyone) should take the Dawn mantle.
- **Skill checks during discussion:**
  - **Persuasion**: Convince others of your viewpoint about who should (or shouldn't) take the mantle
  - **Insight**: Read the true feelings of your companions about this monumental decision
  - **Religion**: Understand the theological implications of the choice for the cosmic order

### The Sunrise Test (If Someone Volunteers)
- If a character volunteers to become the Dawn-Bearer, Ao nods solemnly.
- "Then you must prove you can bear what eternity demands. Face these trials, and the mantle shall be yours."

**Trial 1 - The First Light (Constitution save DC 18):**
- You must kindle the first sunrise in a dead world. Feel the strain of channeling pure creation energy.
- Success: You successfully bring dawn to the lifeless realm
- Failure: The effort nearly breaks you, but your determination sees you through (gain 2 levels of exhaustion but continue)

**Trial 2 - The Endless Vigil (Wisdom save DC 19):**
- Experience a century of mornings in an instant—every dawn you'll ever kindle, every world you'll ever light.
- Success: You maintain your sanity and sense of purpose across the eons
- Failure: The endless repetition nearly drives you to despair, but you find meaning in each individual sunrise (gain 2 levels of exhaustion but continue)

**Trial 3 - The Ultimate Sacrifice (Charisma save DC 20):**
- Understand that, though your companions' lifespans are now longer than those of normal mortals, you will still outlast kingdoms and lineages; friends and loves will pass while you endure.
- Success: You accept this burden with grace, knowing your sacrifice serves the greater good
- Failure: The loneliness of immortality weighs heavily, but you choose duty over personal happiness (gain 2 levels of exhaustion but continue)

- "Choose with wisdom. Whether you stand as demigods together, or one bears the dawn alone, know this: the realms endure because you endured."

## Parting Decree
- "My vigil across broken realities is ended. The multiverse breathes freely for the first time since the first Elderon's desperate gambit."
- "Walk your chosen path with resolve. You have earned what no timeline before achieved: a future written by your own hands, not by the weight of infinite failures."
- "Where order is kept, my hand is steady; where it fails, I return. But for now... I rest, as you have given me that gift."
 - "Unseen by mortal knowledge, I restore the hidden workings of dawn. Yet the first revealed sunrise of the new age I reserve to the Dawn‑Bearer—to kindle before all at a moment of their choosing. Let that day be named as they decree, that hope may remember its hour."

## If One Accepts the Dawn

### The Ascension
- As the chosen kneels, Ao unveils a shard of first light: a star-seed of dawn. Threads of aureate radiance spool from it, lacing through the hero's heart and name.
- Vision floods their senses: every sunrise you have ever witnessed, every dawn yet to be. The weight is vast, but the light teaches how to bear it.
- A corona forms behind you like a low horizon. Your shadow falls forward; your voice carries the warmth of morning.

- "For two dawns and two dusks hence, you may walk the Material Plane of Toril in avatar form as celebration and farewell, that mortals may see the light they saved reflected in those who bore it."

- "Name your charge: speak the Edicts by which your light shall work, and the Instruments by which it moves unseen. Choose one or two edicts and one or two instruments—or shape your own. Let them guide without shackling mortal will."

### Divine Duties of the Dawn-Bearer (Choose 2-3 Focus Areas)
1. **Establishing Dawn Temples**: Build sanctuaries across the realms where the faithful can kindle sacred flames
2. **Cosmic Lighthouse**: Personally visit dying worlds to rekindle their suns and restore hope
3. **Training Dawn Clerics**: Teach mortal servants to carry dawn magic and spread light
4. **The Eternal War**: Fight cosmic entities that devour light and bring endless night
5. **The Morning Council**: Work with other gods to maintain cosmic balance
6. **Mortal Guidance**: Appear to heroes and leaders in their darkest hours

### Maintaining Mortal Connections
- **Charisma check (DC 18)**: How well do you maintain relationships with mortals over the centuries?
  - **Success**: You find ways to stay connected to mortality, perhaps through chosen champions or by walking among them in disguise
  - **Failure**: The burden of godhood slowly distances you from mortal concerns, though you never forget why you chose this path

### Consequences and Boons
- The next dawn across connected realms brightens by a subtle degree; near-world stars kindle truer. Farmers and sailors remark it without knowing why.
- The bearer may walk the mortal world in an avatar for seasons at a time, but must periodically return to the Celestial Halls to rekindle the chorus of day.
- Creatures of living shadow and despair will know the bearer by taste of light and be drawn to oppose them; the land and the faithful will answer in kind.
- The bearer can anoint stewards (once per moon) to keep sacred mornings in key places: sanctuaries that resist blight and withering.
- Oath of the Dawn (spoken by Ao): "Guard the first light. Kindled for all, owned by none. Let no crown claim the sunrise."

### Edicts of the Dawn (choose 1–2 or propose your own)
- Dawn Pact: undead and necrotic constructs exposed to first light take minor radiant harm; sanctified hearth‑light at dawn offers brief warding.
- Covenant of Hospitality: violence against a willing guest beneath a lit hearth before dawn invokes an omen‑curse until the next sunrise.
- First Light Truth: within consecrated dawn‑sites, deliberate lies falter at sunrise; deception becomes markedly harder for an hour.
- Renewal Tithe: once per season, blighted land in open sunlight slowly heals—soil, rivers, and withering curses ease without targeting individuals.

### Instruments of the Dawn (non‑interference tools; choose 1–2)
- Order of the Aurora: a neutral priesthood that keeps beacons, records vows, and trains lantern‑bearers who answer petitions rather than politics.
- Seven Beacons: reawaken ancient lighthouse‑altars; when lit by communities, they repel extraplanar corruption for a day’s march.
- Relics of Morning: seed 3–5 legendary items with geased purposes (shield the helpless; rekindle hope); they choose worthy bearers.
- Dawn Omens: communicate only by signs—a double sunrise, a haloed raven, dust like stars—to approve or warn without commands.
- Horizon Archive: a solar observatory that publishes celestial almanacs—public guidance any realm may follow.

## If None Accept (For Now)
- Ao inclines his head. "So be it. The mantle waits, neither diminished nor impatient. Walk as wardens; when the hour ripens, the choice may be taken anew."
- "There is another whose worth was proven— one who carried the weight and responsibility of hundreds of years across timelines, and yet did not break under the pressure. If you forgo the mantle, this honor shall fall to him."

## Royal Recognition in Waterdeep
- Word of your deeds has reached the highest echelons of power. King Yagomir himself has requested your presence in the City of Splendors.
- The palace courtyard has been transformed for the occasion: banners bearing the arms of every major city you've saved flutter in precise formation, while noble houses vie for position to witness history.

### Arrival and Proclamation
- You do not step from portal to podium. Word spreads first: city bells peal, griffon couriers arc across the sky, and heralds in sun‑yellow tabards announce a public ceremony "at the turning of the next hourglass." You are escorted through the Castle Ward streets as workers rush garlands of dawn‑colored ribbons and white pennants to balconies. Flower vendors pour baskets of pale petals into the hands of children; soon the air will be full of drifting gold and ivory.
- The crowds thicken long before the procession—traders, dockhands, apprentices, all pressing to the avenue edges. Murals hastily sketched in chalk show your battles; a child waves a toy griffon; a baker hands you still‑warm bread in thanks. Every corner is dressed: lanterns veiled in gauze, braziers shaped like rising suns, city guards polished to a mirror shine.

### Palace Quarters (Interlude)
- You are given private chambers within the royal palace for rest, ablutions, and counsel—a quiet hour or two before history resumes. The rooms are cool stone and silken hangings, with wide windows over the bay. A sideboard offers fresh fruit, spiced tea, and a pitcher that never warms. Attendants arrange simple clothes‑brushings and repairs, then withdraw. From the balcony, you can hear the city’s heartbeat shift as streets are cordoned and the banners unfurl.

- **If there is time** You can take a day if you wish to wrap up any loose ends

- [Pyre's Mother](./14.%20Embra.md)

### The Procession Through Waterdeep
- When the hour comes, a door of carved cedar opens to a terraced stair. Trumpets answer bells; the avenue ahead is a corridor of people held at the curb by courteous guards. As you pass, petals fall like pale snow. Sun‑ribboned pennants cross the street every twenty paces; lanterns glow even in daylight, casting warm halos along the route. Shopfronts hang braided wheat and laurel; fishermen lift oars in salute from carts at rest.
- The route climbs toward the palace—past the Fountain of the Falling Stars, past the Hall of Wonders—until the avenue widens into the royal square. Above, the Griffon Cavalry wheel, leaving contrails of glimmering dust that fade like starlight.

### The Ceremony of Champions
- **The Royal Procession**: Trumpeters announce your arrival as you walk a carpet of deep blue velvet scattered with silver stars. Noble spectators line the path, some genuinely awed, others calculating political advantage.
- **The King's Address**: King Yagomir, resplendent in ceremonial armor, speaks from a raised dais:
  - "Before us stand those who have rewritten the fate of realms. When gods fell silent and darkness encroached, these champions answered with deeds that shall echo through the ages."
  - "Let it be recorded in the histories that mortals rose to heights divine, not through conquest or birthright, but through sacrifice and unity."
  - "By right of crown and with consent of the Lords' Alliance, I proclaim the rights and burdens that attend your new station. Hear and bear them before all people of Waterdeep:
     1) Free passage and sanctuary in the cities of the Alliance; no gate barred, no harbor closed.
     2) The Right of Muster in times of dire need: you may raise banners under the Dawn Standard to rally soldiers and spellwrights against threats that imperil the realms. The mustered host returns to its lords when the crisis abates.
     3) A Royal Writ of Audience: at need, you may convene our councils and command our attention for counsel of war or mercy.
     4) Provisional access to the Royal Treasury to provision just endeavors against existential peril, within reason and record.
     5) The Power of Envoy: you may name trusted agents to speak in your stead; the city shall honor their seals as your own.
     These privileges bind you to mercy where possible, to precision where wrath is required, and to the people always."

### Honors Bestowed
- **Titles Granted**:
  - "Defenders of the Dawn" (collectively)
  - Pyre — "the Stormwright"
  - Kalmia — "the Veiled Arrow"
  - Pamykos — "the Concordant Voice"
  - Khadakhadamatazan — "Stormhand"
  - Yrsa — "Valkyrie of Tyr"
- **Royal Privileges**:
  - Free passage and sanctuary in any city of the Lords' Alliance
  - Authority to muster aid in times of dire need
  - Access to the Royal Treasury for future endeavors (within reason)

### The Audience Line (Optional Vignettes)
- The court takes turns approaching with petitions—no tests, just choices:
  - Lord Cassalanter offers a veiled "business" partnership that smells of devils. Accept, refuse, or warn.
  - Lady Margaster floats marriage alliances "for stability." Entertain, decline, or redirect to civic patronage.
  - Mirt the Moneylender pledges real aid and asks for nothing now—only that you call when the realm needs him.
  - Minor lords seek blessings, mediation, or a single word to quiet border disputes. Grant or withhold as you see fit.

### The Royal Challenge
- King Yagomir privately requests a demonstration of your divine power - but safely, without destroying his palace
- **Choose your approach:**
  - **Subtle Display**: Minor miracle or blessing (Performance DC 12)
  - **Impressive Show**: Significant but controlled power demonstration (Arcana DC 15 to keep it safe)
  - **Humble Refusal**: Politely decline while explaining the responsibility of power (Persuasion DC 16)
- The King's reaction depends on your choice and success

### Formal Reception
- Unlike Verbobonc's tavern revelry, this celebration is ritual and pageant together:
  - The Processional of Banners: standards of cities you saved, borne by their stewards, precede you into the courtyard.
  - Oath of the Brazier: a great sun‑brazier is kindled; when its flame flares, the sky over Waterdeep briefly pinks—the first hint of the returning dawn. If a Dawn‑Bearer has ascended, a sliver of true morning spills across the city in that instant.
  - Declarations: each lord steps forward to speak one deed of yours for the record; scribes set quill to silvered vellum.
  - The King’s Benediction: "By right of crown and consent of the people, we name you Defenders of the Dawn. May your judgment be merciful, your wrath precise, and your steps ever toward the light."
  - A final salute from the Griffon Cavalry arcs above, casting petals of pale gold that dissolve like sunlight on snow.

 - If a Dawn‑Bearer chooses the moment, they may unveil the First Dawn of the new age here: the sky brightens from horizon to zenith, and the day is named—"The Dawn of [Title/Name]"—to be kept each year thereafter.

- Forms of Address for Heralds and Court:
  - For a god: "Your Divinity," "Most Luminous," or by domain, e.g., "Your Dawn" (for the Dawn‑Bearer)
  - For a demigod: "Your Eminence," "Exalted One," or "Your Ascendance"
  - For the collective: "Defenders of the Dawn"

### Departure with Purpose
- As you leave the palace, the weight of royal recognition settles differently than Verbobonc's heartfelt gratitude
- The political implications of your new status are clear: the powerful now see you as peers rather than hired help
- The formal recognition marks a transition - you are no longer adventurers, but acknowledged leaders of a new age
