# Return to Verbobonc - Reviving Old Bum

## Arrival in the Rebuilt City

As you approach Verbobonc, the sight that greets you is both familiar and transformed. Where once stood ruins from the dragon's devastation, new buildings rise—some hastily constructed, others showing the careful craftsmanship of those determined to rebuild better than before. The walls have been reinforced, and you can see the scars of battle have been filled with stronger stone.

The guards at the gate recognize you immediately—word of the chosen of the realm has spread far and wide. They wave you through with grateful nods and calls of "Welcome home, champions!"

## The Changed City

### The Bridgewalk District
- Where the Bridgewalk Tavern once stood, a memorial plaza has been erected
- A simple stone bears the names of all who fell during the dragon attack
- Old Bum's name is prominently carved: "Friend to All, Stranger to None"
- Fresh flowers are always present—the townspeople have not forgotten his sacrifice

### The Temple District
- The temples have been rebuilt with additional shrines dedicated to those who fell
- Arabella greets you warmly, mentioning that Ratan visits Old Bum daily
- She leads you to where Old Bum rests in the Temple of Helm's healing chambers

## Old Bum's Condition

### The Vigil
- Old Bum lies in a simple but comfortable bed, looking peaceful despite his coma
- His breathing is steady, but he shows no signs of consciousness
- Ratan sits beside him, reading aloud from various magical texts
- "I've tried everything I know," Ratan admits with frustration. "Healing magic, restoration spells... nothing reaches whatever realm his mind has wandered to."

### The Townspeople's Care
- A rotation of townspeople visit daily, bringing food and tending to his needs
- Children leave small gifts—turnips (his favorite), flowers, simple drawings
- "He saved us all," one elderly woman explains. "The least we can do is watch over him while he heals."

## Administering the Tincture

### Ratan
- "I have done countless hours of study, and have discovered that the tincture must be administered at sunset, when the veil between realms is thinnest, which is a problem now the sun never rises. I know not how we can bring him back under our current circumstances".
- If the group finds a solution:
- "Old Bum must be positioned where he can see the sky, and whoever administers it must speak his true name" (Turnips McGee)

### The Ritual
- Arabella helps move Old Bum to the temple's rooftop garden
- When you carefully pour the tincture between his lips
- For a moment, nothing happens...
- Then his eyes begin to flutter, and a soft golden glow emanates from his skin

### The Awakening
- Old Bum's eyes open slowly, confused and disoriented
- "Did... did we win?" are his first words
- When he sees all of you gathered around him, tears well in his eyes
- "I dreamed I was in the most beautiful garden... there were turnips the size of my belly, and taters..." he pauses for a second and his eyes go wide "... and taternips! Oh how I long for a taternip! Say... do any of you have any turnips?"

## Old Bum's Revelation

### The Divine Connection
- "While I was... away... I think I met someone. An old gardener who said he'd been waiting for me."
- "He told me my real name, but said I should choose what I want to be called now that I'm back"

### His Choice
- "I think... I'd like to be called Nip. It feels right somehow."
- "The gardener — I think it might have been Chauntea herself — she said I have work to do"
- "Something about tending to the seeds of hope that y'all have planted, maybe when we're all done I can tend to taternip seeds"

## The Town's Celebration

### Spontaneous Festival
- Word spreads quickly that Old Bum (now Nip) has awakened
- The entire city erupts in celebration
- Impromptu feasts appear as people bring food from their homes
- Musicians emerge from every corner, and dancing fills the streets. You see the members of the Bodacious Board of Bards including Skug, and Barr and his band The Bardacious Bunch with Flip (Hulusi), Terrin and Hulu.
- Music breaks out and people invite you to feast and play music with them

### The Great Tavern Brawl
- As the evening progresses and ale flows freely, Jambaroni (still bitter about his arena defeat) calls out from across the crowded square
- "Anyone fancy a proper celebration brawl? No weapons, no magic, just good old-fashioned fun!"
- The crowd cheers, and soon a circle forms in the town square

**The Combatants:**
- **Nip (Old Bum)** slides between people's legs, giggling as he attempts to slap their balls with surprising agility
- **Skug the Dwarf** mostly grunts and swings wild haymakers, his prison camp training evident in his surprisingly effective brawling style
- **Jambaroni** wields a large fish he grabbed from a nearby vendor's stall, attempting dramatic slapping maneuvers
- **Gronk the Half-Orc** flexes menacingly but keeps tripping over Nip, who treats this like a game
- **Murrinflurp the Wizard** attempts "tactical combat" but mostly just flails about ineffectively
- **Puzz and Guzz** work as a team until they accidentally punch each other

**Sample Brawl Actions:**
- Jambaroni charges Pamykos wielding his wet fish, shouting "This is for the keytar humiliation!" but slips on spilled ale
- Nip crawls under tables and between legs, popping up to slap balls at crucial moments
- Skug communicates entirely through grunts but somehow coordinates surprisingly effective team attacks
- Gronk attempts to intimidate people but ends up in a tickle fight with Nip
- Murrinflurp tries to cast "non-magical spells" by shouting random arcane words while throwing turnips

**The Environment:**
- Tables and benches become impromptu obstacles and weapons
- Spilled ale makes the cobblestones treacherously slippery
- The crowd cheers and throws harmless objects (bread, flowers, more turnips)
- Musicians continue playing, adjusting the tempo to match the chaos

**Results:**
- Everyone ends up laughing and covered in ale, mud, and various food items
- Jambaroni finally admits they are the stronger group and they all show their respect with nods and shoulder slapping
- Nip is declared the unofficial winner for "creative use of dangle slapping tactics"
- The brawl ends with everyone collapsed in exhausted, drunken laughter

### Celebration Fare and Mystical Libations

As the festivities continue, grateful townspeople bring out their most prized magical concoctions for the heroes who saved their city. Old Garrick, the town's veteran barkeeper, grins and announces the evening's special selection:

"Right then, heroes! Tonight's libations are on the house - our gift to you! We have:
