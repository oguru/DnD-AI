## The Vault of Entombed Light

*Unlike the hellish architecture around it, this structure appears to be of celestial origin—a once-radiant temple now corrupted by eons in the Nine Hells. Its walls are made of black stone that absorbs light, yet intricate patterns of silver and gold still gleam within the material.*

*Ancient inscriptions above the entrance read: "Here lies contained what cannot be destroyed, only guarded. The light of creation is eternal, even in darkness."*

### Entrance Hall of Fallen Light

*A cathedral-like chamber stretches ahead. Shafts of dim light fall from crystals embedded in the ceiling, each beam containing swirling visions of celestial realms. The temperature is cool, a stark contrast to the burning heat of Nessus outside.*

*Stone statues of angelic beings line the walls, their forms twisted by hellish influence. Black tendrils of corruption crawl across the floor and up the bases of the statues.*

*An ornate set of double doors stands slightly ajar at the far end, revealing a glimpse of emerald and gold beyond.*

### The Chronolibrary (New Central Chamber)

*An immense circular chamber stretches beyond the doors. A vast clockwork mechanism dominates the floor—an intricate array of gears, cogs, and celestial symbols inlaid in gold against dark green marble. Roman numerals encircle the outer ring, forming a massive clock face marking time in unfamiliar patterns.*

*Sweeping staircases flank the entrance, leading to upper balconies with ornate railings. The walls are lined with countless bookshelves reaching from floor to ceiling, filled with ancient tomes bound in materials ranging from celestial leather to metals unknown to mortal smiths.*

*Motes of dust hang suspended in the air, unmoving. At the center of the clockwork floor, a circular platform sits above intricate mechanisms. A single grand doorway stands at the far end, its frame inscribed with glowing celestial script.*

Script reads "In times of dire need, those deemed worthy and willing to sacrifice may seek the presence of Kavan'Turok, Destroyer of Souls"

#### Library Contents and Hidden Treasures

*The bookshelves hold an extraordinary collection of celestial knowledge, preserved despite eons in the Nine Hells. Many books are written in languages lost to time, while others shift and change when observed.*

**Books and Tomes:**
- All books previously listed in the "Ancient Lore & Hidden Knowledge" section
- Additional volumes on celestial chronology and the nature of divine time
- Several journals from the celestial guardians who once maintained this place

**Investigation Checks for Hidden Items:**
- DC 10: Scroll of Daylight, Manual of Quickness of Action
- DC 12: Scroll of Scrying, Manual of Bodily Health
- DC 14: Scroll of Flame Strike, Manual of Strength
- DC 16: Scroll of Holy Aura, Tome of Clear Thought
- DC 18: Scroll of Raise Dead, Tome of Leadership and Influence
- DC 20: Tome of Understanding

**The Ancient Records:**
*The celestial inscriptions and journal entries (previously described) can be found within a hidden section of the pedestal bookshelves.*

#### The Warden's Journal

**First Entry**
*"Kavan'Turok, Destroyer of Souls has been sealed within the Vault in the chamber beneath which we study. Fazrael and I stand as its eternal guardians, chosen by Pelor himself for this sacred duty and a great honor. The Spark's power is beyond measure — a fragment of creation itself. We must ensure it never falls into the wrong hands."*

**Later Entry**
*"Pelor has chosen Asterius to ascend as his Avatar. The ceremony was magnificent; the celestial realms themselves seemed to sing. Fazrael attended but left early. There's a darkness in him I've never seen before. He believes he should have been chosen."*

**Troubled Times**
*"Fazrael spends more time in the restricted archives, studying forbidden texts. When I question him, he speaks of 'alternative paths to divinity.' I fear for him, but my duty is to the Spark first. I must maintain my vigil."*

**A Warning Unheeded**
*"I confronted Fazrael about the dark rituals he's been researching. He spoke of taking what he deserves, of how Pelor's choice was a mistake. His eyes held something terrible — ambition twisted into obsession."*

**The Betrayal**
*"It happened so quickly. Asterius visited the Vault on Pelor's behalf. Fazrael... the ritual he performed... By the time I reached the chamber, Asterius lay dead, his divine essence corrupted and absorbed. Fazrael's form had changed, shadows writhing beneath his skin. He was no longer the celestial I had known for eons."*

**Final Entry**
*"Pelor's judgment was swift. Fazrael has been cast out, severed from the divine light forever and forced to wander the mortal realms. But the corruption has already taken hold. He swears he will return, that he will claim what he believes is his. I remain at my post, but I fear this is only the beginning. The Spark must be protected at all costs."*

*The journal ends here, though several pages appear to have been torn out.*

### The Clockwork Mechanism

*The elaborate clockwork floor appears to be more than decorative. With careful observation, you notice that certain gears seem designed to rotate and align in specific configurations.*

- **DC 16 Investigation:** Reveals that the mechanism is a complex lock that, when properly aligned, will cause the central platform to descend to the Inner Sanctum where the Divine Artifact is kept.
- **DC 18 Arcana:** Shows that the mechanism cannot be activated until all three trials have been completed—ethereal threads of divine energy connect the trials to specific gears in the mechanism.

*An inscription near the central platform reads: "The path to divine light opens only to those who have proven their wisdom, insight, and sacrifice. When the Three are one, the way shall be revealed."*

### The Three Trials

*Beyond the doorway lies a  circular chamber with an illusion of stars and the cosmos all around, creating a sense of infinite depth and wonder.*

*At the center, a glowing circular platform pulses with radiant light, serving as a conduit of celestial power. Three archways, each shimmering with ethereal light, lead to different realms or trials.*

*An inscription around the display in the centre of the chamber reads "Three trials await those who seek Kavan'Turok — Sacrifice, Wisdom, and Insight. The path to the Divine Artifact is only revealed to those who complete the trials in order."*

#### 1. Trial of Sacrifice (First Trial)

*The leftmost doorway leads to a room dimly lit by flickering torches. *At the centre of the room stands a mystical basin filled with swirling, ethereal energy. The basin appears to be carved from a single piece of opalescent crystal that pulses with an otherworldly glow.*

*The pedestal bears an inscription in a script that shimmers and changes. The words appear written in an incomprehensible language, yet you manage to understand their meaning: "All those who wish to enter the sacred sanctum of the vault must sacrifice something of true value. It can be an object that makes you whole, a loved one, or a piece of yourself. The price of progress is sacrifice."*

*Tendrils of luminous mist rise from its surface, reaching out as if beckoning offerings to be placed within its depths. The very air around it seems to ripple with potential, ready to consume whatever sacrifice is presented.*

*A soft, ethereal voice echoes the words on the inscription: "To proceed, surrender something of true value. The choice is yours, but the path ahead demands sacrifice."*

- Must sacrifice something of value:
  - Cherished memory (lose skill proficiency temporarily)
  - Hit points (reduce maximum by 10 temporarily)
  - Magic item (returned after retrieving Kavan'Turok, Destroyer of Souls)
- **Alternative solution:** True sacrifice of pride/selfishness (roleplayed convincingly)

*This trial was deliberately placed first to deter even the celestial guardians from proceeding further out of curiosity. Any being, no matter how powerful, must give up something of true value to continue.*

#### 2. Trial of Wisdom (Second Trial)

*The middle path leads to an ancient door of polished obsidian. Unlike other doors in this place, it bears no obvious lock or handle. The door's surface is etched with strange, weathered grooves that seem to pulse with a faint, otherworldly resonance when touched.*

*Scattered across the door's face are four symbols that are unknown to you, although the first and last symbol are the same. They appear to be arranged in some deliberate pattern, though their meaning remains elusive.*

*At the top of the door, barely legible ancient script reads: "When the living fall still and breath ceases its dance, only then may passage be granted. To cross this threshold, one must play dead."*

**Hints**

- The final words seem oddly mundane compared to the rest of the ornate door, as if added as an afterthought by a different hand entirely.

- You find a journal note on the floor from someone who had been here previously. It reads "I have tried all manner of playing dead, even going so far as to sacrifice my animal companion, but nothing works. It has been days now and I have given up hope of entering this unknown sanctum. If you are reading this, I hope you fare better than I do."

- The arcane symbols are ancient letters that spell out DEAD.

#### 3. Trial of Insight (Third Trial)

*The rightmost path leads to a room filled with various weapon racks and all sorts of different weapons surrounding a statue of a knight with an outstretched hand, and a plaque that says "Bring to me the greatest weapon, that kings covet, puts warriors to ruin, and ends all battles."* 

*The weapon racks hold an impressive array of arms:*

- A longsword with intricate wave patterns etched along the blade
- A warhammer whose head is carved to resemble a roaring lion
- A glaive with delicate silver inlays depicting falling leaves
- A battleaxe bearing dwarven runes of victory
- A greatsword with a phoenix motif on the crossguard
- A mace whose head is shaped like a blooming rose
- A rapier with a handle wrapped in preserved vines
- A shortsword with a crescent moon pommel
- A spear shaft carved with spiraling dragons
- A scimitar with desert winds etched on the blade
- A morningstar studded with polished gemstones
- A sword with an olive branch engraved on the handle
- A war pick whose shaft shows mountain peaks
- A maul decorated with lightning bolt patterns
- A halberd bearing celestial script along its edge that reads "For the stars, we fight."

*Putting any weapon in the hand of the statue causes it to become animated and it attacks. Among the weapons is a sword called "Peacemaker", with an olive branch engraved in the handle. Placing the peacemaker in the hand of the statue solves the puzzle.*

### Animated Statue (Trial of Insight)

*Medium construct, unaligned*

**Armor Class:** 18 (natural armor)  
**Hit Points:** 142 (15d8 + 75)  
**Speed:** 30 ft.  

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 20 (+5) | 14 (+2) | 20 (+5) | 3 (-4)  | 10 (+0) | 1 (-5)  |

**Saving Throws:** Str +10, Con +10  
**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic  
**Condition Immunities:** blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned  
**Senses:** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 10  
**Challenge:** 15 (13,000 XP)  

**Immutable Form.** The statue is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The statue has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The statue's weapon attacks are magical.

**Trial Guardian.** The statue cannot leave the trial chamber and will continue to attack until defeated or until the correct solution is presented.

**Actions:**

***Multiattack.*** The statue makes three weapon attacks.

***Weapon Attack.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) damage of the appropriate type (slashing for swords, bludgeoning for hammers/maces, piercing for spears, etc.).

***Whirlwind of Blades (Recharge 5-6).*** The statue spins rapidly, forcing each creature within 10 feet to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**Reactions:**

***Parry.*** The statue adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the statue must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

***Counterattack.*** When a creature within 5 feet of the statue misses it with a melee attack, the statue can make one weapon attack against that creature.

### The Mechanism Activates

*When all three trials have been completed, the Chronolibrary fills with resonant harmonics as the great clockwork mechanism begins to move. Gears long dormant rotate, aligning celestial symbols in patterns that seem to ripple through reality itself.*

*When you move onto the platform and place your hands in the centre it begins to slowly descend, creating a spiral staircase that leads down to the Inner Sanctum.*

### The Inner Sanctum - Confrontation with Fazrahl

*At the bottom of the stairs there is a single doorway. As you finish descending, the stairs begin to retract, leaving a chamber with the doorway ahead. 

*Through the door, at the end of the room lies an ornate but empty gemstone-encrusted stand. Before it  Fazrahl stands before it, his hand grasping the hilt of a brilliant point of light—Kavan'Turok, Destroyer of Souls—its power contained within a web of glowing sigils that seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy.*

*A tall figure stands before the Spark—a being draped in shadows with eyes that gleam like distant stars.*

*"Ah, right on schedule," he says. "I am Fazrahl, and I must thank you for testing the defenses of this place so thoroughly, and for bringing the other artifacts to me. I have been watching you closely, it mattered not who obtained the divine sparks, but this is your final confrontation."*

#### The Confrontation

#### The Corruption of Athkatla
*The vision shows the ruins of Athkatla—a city already claimed by darkness. The corrupted leylines that Fazrahl rerouted around the city pulse with sickly green energy, their paths forming an intricate ritual circle.*

*Fazrahl stands at the heart of his ruined domain, divine sparks pulsing in his grasp. The corrupted leylines respond, their dark energy spiraling upward, amplified by the thousands of souls he previously sacrificed. The very ground groans as he channels power through the paths he prepared, using the city itself as a focus for his ultimate ritual.*

#### The Celestial Breach
*Reality tears open above the corrupted city. A massive rift splits the sky, revealing the pristine realm of the celestials. Fazrahl rises through the breach, the merged artifacts—Shield of Dawn, Shadowdancer's Veil, and Kavan'Turok—orbiting him. The green spark pulses, and the artifacts draw together, melding into a single weapon of terrible beauty: Guth'bani, God's Bane.*

#### Confrontation with the Dawnfather
*Pelor's divine realm materializes—a palace of pure light where reality itself burns with radiance. The Dawnfather rises from his solar throne, his true form too brilliant to comprehend. Divine power erupts from his hands, a beam of pure sunlight that would annihilate a lesser being.*

*Fazrahl raises Guth'bani. The weapon drinks in Pelor's light like a void consuming stars. Fazrahl staggers but stands, darkness seeping from his form. "Your time is done, father."*

#### The Death of Dawn
*Guth'bani strikes. Light fractures. Pelor falls. His divine essence streams into an arcanite crystal in Fazrahl's grasp. Guth'bani crumbles to ash, its purpose fulfilled. The crystal pulses once, twice—then shatters as Fazrahl absorbs its power.*

*Across all realms, the sun dims. Darkness creeps across the world as the Dawnfather's light fades forever.*

#### The Rise of Night's King
*In Athkatla, cultists kneel in darkened temples. Their prayers rise like smoke, strengthening their dark god. Fazrahl's power grows, reality warping around him. The corruption spreads outward from the city like a stain across parchment.*

*The vision fades to darkness, but one final image lingers: Fazrahl seated upon a throne of corrupted celestial metal, his form both beautiful and terrible—a god born of betrayal and shadow, preparing to reshape all of creation.*

# Fazrahl Fight

# Divine Intervention - Jizzrek

*Darkness envelops you, but instead of the expected void of death, you find yourselves in a strange, misty realm. You start to make out the silhouette of a small creature as the mist begins to clear and your eyes focus, until you see the familiar wrinkled goblin and gnome features you've come to expect in strange situations. Jizzrek stands before you wearing ancient looking robes adorned with forgotten holy symbols.*

- He hoped the group would defeat Fazrahl.
- He kept an eye on them and others to see who is most worthy.
- He will give his divinity as a last resort

"Jizzrek go where jizzrek needed, yeh, yeh. Once worship, now nearly forgotten. Jizzrek look for strongest, specialist warriors for worthy of jizzrek remain power. Jizzrek test best warriors with best magic items, heh, heh heh. Jizzrek watched struggle, choose strongest, bravest warriors for stop Fazrahl, yeh yeh."*

- *If asked why he didn't help them before...*

*"Only in defeat, find unity, only between realm can Jizz'rek give best gift. Jizz'rek no allow make direct interfere or Jizz'rek stopped."*

*"Jizzrek not power enough make ripple for other gods notice interfere, or for stop Fazrahl, but with most great warriors, maybe enough make difference, stop fazrahl, protect realm. Jizz'rek give final gift, bring back best customers, give spark, and save best magic items for make stronger for strongest warriors. Power grow over time, use wise, best cust...omer...."*

#### Resurrection and Divine Gifts

- Characters return to life where they fell
- Each receives a portion of Jizzrek's power:
  - Temporary hit points equal to twice character level
  - One-time advantage on any roll when declared
  - Resistance to necrotic damage for 24 hours
  - One additional action per combat for the next 24 hours

### Escape and Unexpected Encounter

With Kavan'Turok, Destroyer of Souls gone, the Vault begins to destabilize. 



**Escape Options:**
- The repaired teleportation circle in the Forgotten Outpost
- The celestial portal in the Entrance Hall (can be activated with Jizzrek's power)
- The same way they came in

## Conclusion

The characters escape Nessus with newfound divine power from Jizzrek but without Kavan'Turok, Destroyer of Souls. They now possess crucial knowledge about Fazrahl's plans to collect all four Divine Sparks and must find a way to stop him before he can reshape reality itself.

### Kavan'Turok, Destroyer of Souls (Description for GM)

Kavan'Turok, Destroyer of Souls is one of four primordial fragments of creation:
- **Light Spark** (the one in Nessus) - Represents illumination, truth, and revelation
- **Life Spark** - Embodies growth, healing, and vitality
- **Law Spark** - Encompasses order, structure, and civilization
- **Death Spark** (the hidden fourth) - Controls endings, transformation, and renewal

When united, these four aspects grant control over the fundamental forces of reality.

The Vault of Entombed Light was created by celestial beings to contain the Light Spark after discovering it could not be destroyed. Over eons, the Nine Hells formed around it, eventually incorporating the Vault into Nessus.

## Notes for the DM

- The Chronolibrary serves as both a knowledge repository and the central hub for the Vault
- Players should be encouraged to explore and gain knowledge before attempting the trials
- The clockwork mechanism ties thematically to the celestial nature of the vault—time, precision, and divine planning
- Consider allowing clever players to deduce information about the trials from the books in the library
- The layout provides a natural progression: entrance → knowledge gathering → trials → Inner Sanctum
