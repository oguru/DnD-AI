# Sealing the Breach: Divine Trial 2

## The Planar Incursion

### The Situation
- A planar rift has erupted in Waterdeep's Trade Ward, tearing through the market square
- Four planes are attempting to connect to the Material Plane: the Shadowfell, Elemental Chaos, Nine Hells, and the Abyss
- Waterdhavian guards have established a perimeter but are rapidly losing ground
- The rift grows more stable with each passing minute, allowing stronger entities to emerge

### The Breach Site
- The marble plaza is fractured and half-sunken around the shattered Moon Fountain
- Four concentric rings of glyphs—one for each plane—pulse in sequence as each connection stabilizes
- Reality buckles within 120 ft. of the rift: normal flight is impossible (hover only) and non-magical flames sputter out
- Tyr's sigil manifests faintly in the cobbles when Divine characters stand upon them, granting allies advantage on saves vs. fear within 30 ft.

### Divine Insight
- The rift is held open by four overlapping planar threads that must be severed in sequence
- Each planar wave leaves behind a tangible shard of essence needed to seal the portal
- Deep within the swirling vortex, a great and ancient evil awaits its chance to enter Faerûn

## Allied Resources

### Waterdeep Defenders
- **City Watch**: 40 guards holding the outer perimeter, led by Captain Hyustus Staget
- **Blackstaff Tower**: 3 apprentice wizards maintaining protective wards
- **Griffon Cavalry**: 5 riders providing aerial reconnaissance and limited support

### Civilian Support
- **Priests of Tyr**: 4 clerics providing healing and blessings
- **Waterdhavian Nobles**: Several noble houses have offered resources and safe haven for evacuees
- **Adventurers' Guild**: Various adventuring parties helping with evacuation

### Phase 3: Moryx, Harbinger of the Abyss

When the Abyssal wave is reduced to half strength (4 groups remaining), Moryx emerges from the rift.

#### Moryx the Doombringer
*Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil*

- **AC:** 22
- **HP:** 1500
- **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 80 ft.
- **Saving Throws:** Str +14, Con +13, Wis +10
- **Damage Resistances:** cold, fire, lightning
- **Damage Immunities:** poison, necrotic
- **Condition Immunities:** frightened, poisoned
- **Divine Vulnerability:** Radiant damage bypasses resistances and deals an additional 10 damage per hit (Tyr's blessing)

**Multiattack.** Moryx makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its bite.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d10+10) slashing damage.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 38 (4d12+10) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.

**Abyssal Roar (Recharge 5–6).** Moryx emits a terrifying roar in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 56 (16d6) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

**Soul Rend.** Moryx targets one creature it can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target's Divine abilities are suppressed until the end of its next turn.

**Legendary Actions.** Moryx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Moryx regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Attack.** Moryx makes one claw attack.
- **Move.** Moryx moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Cast Spell.** Moryx casts dispel magic or counterspell without using components.
- **Soul Rend (Costs 3 Actions).** Moryx uses its Soul Rend ability.

**Mythic Actions.** If Moryx is reduced to 0 hit points, its abyssal essence detonates in a surge of chaotic energy. It isn't defeated and instead regains 200 hit points. In addition:
- Moryx's wings dissolve into ichor that covers the ground in a 60-foot radius, turning it into difficult terrain
- Moryx's damage dice increase by one step (d10→d12, d12→2d8)
- Moryx can use its Soul Rend ability as a bonus action once per round

**Expected Difficulty:** 8/10 (9/10 with remaining Abyssal groups)

### Phase 4: Closing the Rift

- Three heroes must use their Divine Spark while holding the Planar Shards
- Each hero makes a DC 20 Religion or Arcana check as a bonus action
- When three heroes succeed in the same round, the rift collapses
- Any remaining planar entities are pulled back to their home planes

## Divine Transcendence

### The Final Blessing
- As the portal collapses, divine energy surges into the party
- The voice of their celestial patron speaks: "The second trial is complete. Your divine essence has reached its zenith."
- The party experiences a dramatic transformation as they achieve Divine Level 3

### Divine Level 3 Manifestation
- Players receive all Level 3 divine abilities
- Physical appearance becomes overtly divine (glowing symbols on skin, eyes of pure light, etc.)
- An immediate sense of Fazrahl's location and current activities
- Vision of the celestial deity: "Return to me now. The time has come to end Fazrahl's reign."

### Fazrahl's Fury
- The party witnesses a vision of Fazrahl in a rage, sensing his plans being thwarted
- He accelerates his final plan, drawing on reserves of stolen divine power
- The sky darkens across the Sword Coast as divine energy is twisted and corrupted

## Rewards and Aftermath

### From Grateful Waterdeep
- **Scroll of Plane Shift** to return to the celestial realm
- **Potions of Supreme Healing** (3)
- Information about a weakness in Fazrahl's divine form
- The gratitude of the Lords of Waterdeep

### From the Closed Rift
- The purified energy of the sealed breach coalesces into a divine artifact:
- **Shard of Reality**: Once per day, can create a 20-foot dome where reality is stabilized (anti-magic field for hostile spells only)

### From Moryx's Defeat
- As Moryx falls, its essence can be captured in a special container
- **Contained Demonic Essence**: Can be used to track Fazrahl through planar boundaries
- Pamykos feels a final connection sever, granting permanent resistance to fear effects

## The Road Ahead

### Next Steps
- Return to the celestial realm for final guidance
- Receive information on Fazrahl's exact location and vulnerabilities
- Make final preparations for the confrontation
- Learn of a secret way to enter Fazrahl's divine domain

### Urgency
- With each passing hour, Fazrahl's power grows more unstable
- The celestial deity warns that reality itself is at risk
- The final confrontation must happen soon, before Fazrahl's transformation is complete

## DM Notes
- This encounter is designed for 18th-level characters with Divine Level 2 powers and Tyr's blessing
- The group system allows for streamlined combat while still presenting a challenge
- Each wave should take approximately 2-3 rounds of combat
- Moryx should be a significant challenge even for divinely empowered characters
- Consider the party's resources when determining if they need a short rest between waves
- The difficulty ratings are calibrated based on the previous encounters in the God Power Battle Notes
