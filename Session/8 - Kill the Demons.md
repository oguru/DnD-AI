# Sealing the Breach: Divine Trial 2

## The Planar Incursion

### The Situation
- A planar rift has erupted in Waterdeep's Trade Ward, tearing through the market square
- Four planes are attempting to connect to the Material Plane
- Waterdhavian guards have established a perimeter but are rapidly losing ground
- The rift grows more stable with each passing minute, allowing stronger entities to emerge

### The Breach Site
- The marble plaza is fractured and half-sunken around the shattered Moon Fountain
- Four concentric rings of glyphs—one for each plane—pulse in sequence as each connection stabilizes
- Reality buckles within 120 ft. of the rift: normal flight is impossible (hover only) and non-magical flames sputter out
- Tyr's sigil manifests faintly in the cobbles when Divine characters stand upon them, granting allies advantage on saves vs. fear within 30 ft.

### Divine Insight
- The rift is held open by four overlapping planar threads that must be severed in sequence
- Each planar wave leaves behind a tangible shard of essence needed to seal the portal
- Deep within the swirling vortex, a great and ancient evil awaits its chance to enter Faerûn

## Allied Resources

### Waterdeep Defenders
- **City Watch**: 40 guards holding the outer perimeter, led by Captain Hyustus Staget
- **Blackstaff Tower**: 3 apprentice wizards maintaining protective wards

- **Priests of Tyr**: 4 clerics providing healing and blessings

### Phase 3: Moryx, Harbinger of the Abyss

When the Abyssal wave is reduced to half strength (4 groups remaining), a massive entity emerges from the rift.

#### The Demon's Emergence
The rift tears wider with a deafening roar as reality itself seems to scream in protest. From within the churning vortex, a massive clawed hand erupts, gripping the edge of the portal with such force that the cobblestones beneath crack and splinter. The air grows unbearably hot as a large form pulls itself through the dimensional tear.

Standing nearly twenty feet tall, the demon in front of you is a nightmarish fusion of what appears to be molten rock and living flame. His massive chest heaves as he takes his first breath of Material Plane air, each exhalation releasing plumes of sulfurous smoke.

The demon surveys the battlefield, his molten gaze sweeping across the defenders of Waterdeep before settling on the party. His maw splits into a terrible grin, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth that glow like hot coals.

*"FREE! FREE AT LAST!"* The demon's voice booms across the plaza, causing windows to shatter and the ground to tremble. *"All shall tremble before the might of Moryx the Doombringer, Destroyer of a Thousand Realms, Scourge of the Celestial Planes!"*

**To the Group:**
*"Divine champions,"* he mocks, his voice a thunderous rumble that seems to emanate from the depths of the Abyss itself. *"How pathetic that the gods would pin their hopes on such frail vessels. Your divine sparks are but candles before my inferno."*

He spreads his massive arms wide, causing the flames around him to surge higher. *"Behold true power! What your gods dispense in droplets, I shall unleash in torrents! This city will be the first to burn in my new reign."*

**To Pamykos:**
His burning gaze fixes on Pamykos. *"Ah, and here is my former shell. I have waited for this moment, to look upon you with my true eyes. I have yearned for vengeance ever since you cast me out."*

*"I no longer need your pitiful mortal form to contain my essence. The portal has given me passage in my true glory. Now, I shall take particular pleasure in consuming what remains of your soul—a fitting reunion for host and master."*

*"I remember every moment of our time together, little one. Every fear, every weakness, every secret thought. And when I am done with you, your companions will follow, and then this entire realm."*

With that, Moryx lets out a deafening roar that shakes the very foundations of the plaza, and the battle begins.

#### Moryx the Doombringer
*Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil*

- **AC:** 25
- **HP:** 2750
- **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 80 ft.
- **Saving Throws:** Str +16, Con +15, Wis +12
- **Damage Resistances:** cold, fire, lightning
- **Damage Immunities:** poison, necrotic
- **Condition Immunities:** frightened, poisoned, stunned

**Multiattack.** Moryx makes four attacks: two with its fists one with its bite and one with its tail.

**Swipe.** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 38 (5d12+12) bludgeoning damage.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 38 (6d12+14) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: DC24 Dex save, 15 ft. radius, AOE. 51 (6d12+12) piercing damage and restrained (DC24) or half on save.

**Abyssal Roar (Recharge 4).** Moryx emits a terrifying roar in a 60-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 20d12 thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

**Soul Rend.** Moryx targets one creature it can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw, taking 20d12 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target's Divine abilities are suppressed until the end of its next turn.

**Possess Pamykos (Recharge 3).** Moryx can use a bonus action to attempt to reconnect with its former host, Pamykos. Pamykos must make a DC 22 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, Pamykos takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage and is possessed until the end of Moryx's next turn as painful memories of possession flood back. Additionally, Moryx heals equal to the damage dealt. On a successful save, Pamykos takes half damage and isn't possessed. This ability can be used once every 3 rounds.

**Legendary Actions.** Moryx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Moryx regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Attack.** Moryx makes one claw attack.
- **Move.** Moryx moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Cast Spell.** Moryx casts dispel magic or counterspell without using components.
- **Soul Rend (Costs 2 Actions).** Moryx uses its Soul Rend ability.
- **Former Host Connection (Costs 3 Actions).** Moryx uses its Former Host Connection ability against Pamykos if available.

**Mythic Actions.** If Moryx is reduced to 0 hit points, its abyssal essence detonates in a surge of chaotic energy. It isn't defeated and instead regains 400 hit points. In addition:
- Moryx's wings dissolve into ichor that covers the ground in a 60-foot radius, turning it into difficult terrain
- Moryx can use its Soul Rend ability as a bonus action once per round
- Moryx gains a new ability: **Abyssal Dominance**. As an action, Moryx creates a 30-foot radius sphere of abyssal energy centered on itself. The sphere remains for 1 minute or until Moryx is defeated. Within the sphere, all non-divine creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. Divine creatures must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn or take 27 (6d8) necrotic damage.

**Expected Difficulty:** 8/10 (9/10 with remaining Abyssal groups)

### Phase 4: Closing the Rift

- Three heroes must use their Divine Spark while holding the Planar Shards
- Each hero makes a DC 20 Religion or Arcana check as a bonus action
- When three heroes succeed in the same round, the rift collapses
- Any remaining planar entities are pulled back to their home planes

## Divine Transcendence

### The Final Blessing
- As the portal collapses, divine energy surges into the party
- The voice of their celestial patron speaks: "The second trial is complete. Your divine essence has reached its zenith."
- The party experiences a dramatic transformation as they achieve Divine Level 3

- Physical appearance becomes overtly divine (glowing symbols on skin, eyes of pure light, etc.)
- An immediate sense of Fazrahl's location and current activities

### Fazrahl's Fury
- The party witnesses a vision of Fazrahl in a rage, sensing his plans being thwarted

- The sky darkens across the Sword Coast as divine energy is twisted and corrupted

- **Contained Demonic Essence**: Can be used to track Fazrahl through planar boundaries
