# Sealing the Breach: Divine Trial 2

## The Demonic Incursion

### The Situation
- A massive portal has opened in the countryside near Baldur's Gate
- Demonic forces are pouring through, ravaging villages and corrupting the land
- Local military forces are overwhelmed and retreating
- The portal grows larger with each passing hour, allowing more powerful demons to emerge

### The Breach Site
- A once-sacred grove now corrupted and blackened
- At the center, an ancient stone circle serves as the anchor for the portal
- The air is thick with sulfurous fumes and the temperature rises as you approach
- Corrupted ley lines pulse with unholy energy, feeding the portal

### Divine Insight
- The party's divine senses reveal the portal's structure:
  - Seven anchor points that must be severed
  - A central keystone that maintains the connection
  - The presence of a powerful entity from the party's past (Moryx)

## Allied Resources

### Remaining Forces
- Any surviving forces from Athkatla can join the assault
- Gideon and his remaining paladins (approximately 12-15)
- Okurak and his werebears (if they survived)

### New Allies
- **Baldur's Gate Defensive Force**: 30 soldiers led by Captain Voren
- **Circle of Druids**: 5 druids attempting to heal the land, led by Archdruid Elara
- **Mercenary Band**: The Red Falcons, a group of 8 experienced demon hunters

## The Assault Plan

### Phase 1: Clear the Approach
- Demonic forces have established a perimeter around the portal
- Objective: Break through the defensive lines to reach the stone circle
- Environment: Blighted countryside, burning villages, corrupted wildlife

#### Encounter 1: The Vanguard
- Wave 1: 10 Dretches (CR 1/4 each) and 6 Rutterkin (CR 2 each)
- Wave 2: 4 Barlgura (CR 5 each) and 8 Bulezau (CR 3 each)
- Wave 3: 2 Vrock (CR 6 each) with 6 Hezrou (CR 8 each)
- Tactics: Demons fight in chaotic patterns, focusing on isolating party members

### Phase 2: Anchor Points
- Seven corrupted standing stones must be cleansed to weaken the portal
- Party can split up or tackle them sequentially
- Each stone is guarded by increasingly powerful demons

#### Encounter 2: The Seven Anchors
Each anchor point presents a similar challenge:
- 1 Guardian Demon (CR varies from 5-10)
- 3-4 Lesser Demons as support
- A corrupted environmental effect (necrotic field, fiery eruptions, etc.)
- Objective: Perform a quick ritual (3 rounds) to cleanse the stone while defending against demons

**Sample Anchor Guardians:**
1. Shadow Demon Matriarch (CR 6) with 4 Shadow Demons (CR 4 each)
2. Barlgura Alpha (CR 7) with 3 Barlgura (CR 5 each)
3. Chasme Swarm (CR 8) with 6 Dretches (CR 1/4 each)
4. Hezrou Champion (CR 9) with 3 Rutterkin (CR 2 each)
5. Corrupt Water Elemental (CR 7) with 3 Water Weirds (CR 3 each)
6. Fiendish Wyvern (CR 8) with 4 Imps (CR 1 each)
7. Glabrezu (CR 9) with 2 Chasme (CR 6 each)

### Phase 3: The Keystone
- Once all anchors are cleansed, the portal begins to destabilize
- The central keystone must be shattered to close the portal completely
- As the party approaches, Moryx emerges from the portal, recognizing Pamykos

#### Encounter 3: Moryx the Doombringer

*The air grows unnaturally cold. The constant sound of the portal's chaotic energy fades to an eerie silence. A massive figure steps through the breachâ€”a towering demon with curved horns, wings of decaying flesh, and eyes that burn with recognition and hatred.*

*The demon's gaze fixes on Pamykos with terrible recognition. "The shell returns to me," it growls. "I smell my essence upon you still, mortal. Our bond was severed prematurely, but here, at the nexus of planes, I am WHOLE!"*

*It lunges forward, form shifting between solid matter and shadowy essence. "You denied me your flesh as a vessel, so I shall take your soul as tribute instead!"*

##### Moryx Stats and Abilities
*Large fiend (demon), chaotic evil*

- **AC:** 19
- **HP:** 320
- **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 60 ft.
- **Divine Vulnerability:** The celestial power granted by Jizz'rek is especially effective against Moryx, dealing double damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Essence Link:** Establishes a connection with Pamykos, sharing damage (when one takes damage, both take half)
- **Soul Drain:** 12d10 necrotic damage, DC 21 Con save for half
- **Shadow Step:** 60 ft. teleport to any area of shadow as a bonus action
- **Nightmare Gaze:** 4d10 psychic damage + frightened, DC 21 Wis save
- **Demonic Regeneration:** Regains 20 HP at the start of its turn unless it took radiant damage
- **Hellfire Burst:** 60-ft cone, 10d6 fire damage, DC 19 Dex save for half
- **Legendary Actions:** 3 per round (attack, move, cast spell)
- **Legendary Resistance:** 3 per day

##### Battle Dynamics
- **Phase 1:** Moryx focuses entirely on Pamykos, attempting to reestablish the broken connection
- **Phase 2:** At 50% HP, Moryx summons 1d4+2 Shadow Demons to distract the party
- **Phase 3:** Below 25% HP, Moryx becomes desperate and attempts to drag Pamykos back through the portal

##### Emotional Elements
- Moryx knows personal details about Pamykos and taunts with them
- Attempts to exploit any guilt or fear Pamykos has about their past connection
- Offers power in exchange for submission: "Together we could challenge Fazrahl himself!"

### Phase 4: Sealing the Breach
- With Moryx defeated, the party must perform a final ritual to seal the keystone
- Divine energy from their growing power is required to complete the seal
- As the ritual concludes, a massive implosion closes the portal and cleanses the area

## Divine Transcendence

### The Final Blessing
- As the portal collapses, divine energy surges into the party
- The voice from the celestial realm speaks: "The second trial is complete. Your divine essence has reached its zenith."
- The party experiences a dramatic transformation as they achieve Divine Level 3

### Divine Level 3 Manifestation
- Players receive all Level 3 divine abilities
- Physical appearance becomes overtly divine (glowing symbols on skin, eyes of pure light, etc.)
- An immediate sense of Fazrahl's location and current activities
- Vision of the celestial deity: "Return to me now. The time has come to end Fazrahl's reign."

### Fazrahl's Fury
- The party witnesses a vision of Fazrahl in a rage, sensing his plans being thwarted
- He accelerates his final plan, drawing on reserves of stolen divine power
- The sky darkens across the Sword Coast as divine energy is twisted and corrupted

## Rewards and Aftermath

### From Grateful Survivors
- **Scroll of Plane Shift** to return to the celestial realm
- **Potions of Supreme Healing** (3)
- Information about a weakness in Fazrahl's divine form

### From the Cleansed Land
- The purified energy of the sealed breach coalesces into a divine artifact:
- **Shard of Reality**: Once per day, can create a 20-foot dome where reality is stabilized (anti-magic field for hostile spells only)

### From Moryx's Defeat
- As Moryx falls, its essence can be captured in a special container
- **Contained Demonic Essence**: Can be used to track Fazrahl through planar boundaries
- Pamykos feels a final connection sever, granting permanent resistance to fear effects

## The Road Ahead

### Next Steps
- Return to the celestial realm for final guidance
- Receive information on Fazrahl's exact location and vulnerabilities
- Make final preparations for the confrontation
- Learn of a secret way to enter Fazrahl's divine domain

### Urgency
- With each passing hour, Fazrahl's power grows more unstable
- The celestial deity warns that reality itself is at risk
- The final confrontation must happen soon, before Fazrahl's transformation is complete

## DM Notes
- Emphasize the growing divine nature of the characters
- Allow them to showcase their new powerful abilities against the demons
- Make the confrontation with Moryx personal for Pamykos
- Consider allowing allies to handle some of the lesser demons while the party focuses on key objectives
- Prepare for the transition to the final confrontation
- Consider how Fazrahl might attempt to counter the party's growing power
