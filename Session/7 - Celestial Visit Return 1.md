# Celestial Realm Return - Tyr

## Return to Tyr

### Tyr's Reception
- Tyr rises from his throne as the party returns, his blind justice-seeing eyes somehow reflecting their accomplishment
- *"The scales of justice have begun to balance once more. I have felt the shift across the planes."*
- *"Fazrahl's essence has been diminished by your actions. The corruption of Athkatla's leylines no longer feeds his stolen divinity."*
- *"You have struck the first meaningful blow against this usurper. Order begins to reassert itself where chaos reigned."*
- *"Your divine spark continues to grow - I can see it yearning to reach its full potential within each of you."*

### The Growing Legend
- *"Word of your deeds spreads across Faerûn like wildfire. 'The Saviors of Verbobonc,', 'The Heroes of Athkatla,' and now 'The Chosen of the Realms' - these names echo in taverns and noble courts alike."*
- *"This recognition strengthens divine power. As mortals speak your names with reverence, your capacity to channel celestial energy grows."*
- *"The threads of destiny binding you to the divine realms are reinforced by each soul who believes in your purpose."*
- *"This connection to the mortal realm's collective faith makes you uniquely suited to wield greater divine power against Fazrahl."*

### To Yrsa
- Tyr's gaze shifts, his attention focusing on Yrsa as the divine light around him intensifies
- *"And among these chosen heroes, each plays a unique role in this divine struggle."*
- *"Yrsa, faithful servant. You have carried my banner into darkness and emerged victorious."*
- *"Your dedication to justice has never wavered, even when faced with divine corruption."*
- *"Know that your actions in Athkatla have been recorded in the Halls of Justice. The celestial courts speak your name with honor."*
- *"Continue to be my hand in the mortal realm, for there are few I trust more with such responsibility."*

### The Divine Blessing
- Tyr extends his hand, a radiant light emanating from his palm
- *"You have all proven worthy of greater divine power. Kneel and receive my blessing."*
- As the party kneels, a surge of divine energy flows through them
- *"I strengthen the divine essence within you. Feel your connection to the celestial realms grow more profound."*
- Each character feels a new power awakening within them, their divine essence becoming more vibrant and responsive
- *"This blessing is but one step in your journey. Another awaits you after your next trial."*

### The Path Forward
- *"Though weakened, Fazrahl the Devourer grows desperate. Desperation makes even gods dangerous."*
- *"To face him directly, you will need the blessing of one more deity after completing their divine task."*
- *"I sense that the cosmic balance requires this - only then will your divine spark be strong enough to challenge Fazrahl's stolen divinity."*
- *"Several deities have observed your progress and each offers a different path forward."*
- *"Which divine ally do you wish to consult next? Their domain will shape your next blessing, and this final trial will prepare you for the confrontation with Fazrahl himself."*

## [Selected Deity]'s Guidance

### Divine Revelation
- *"Fazrahl's desperation has manifested in several threats across Faerûn, but I sense the greatest immediate threat is in Waterdeep, where the barriers between planes grow thin."*

### The Planar Threat
- *"As we speak, Fazrahl is opening a tear between the planes in the heart of the city - a city of splendor now facing abyssal horror."*
- *"He intends to unleash Demons and Devils into Faerun - while mortals suffer, he will feed on their pain and terror to try to restore what he has lost."*

### The Portal Crisis
- *"Fazrahl has created a nexus of planar convergence within Waterdeep's Trade Ward."*
- *"I can sense connections forming to four other lower planes, and a great and ancient evil waiting to break through to your world."*
- *"The longer the portal stays up, the more stable it becomes. If it becomes permanent, Waterdeep will fall, and the material plane will face an invasion unlike any before."*

### The Divine Solution
- *"My divine domain gives me unique insight into this particular threat. I can guide you in ways others could not."*
- *"To close the portal, you must confront the waves of creatures emerging as each planar connection stabilizes."*
- *"From each planar wave, you must seize something infused with its native essence – enough to weaken that connection in the fabric of the portal in order to make it susceptible to attack."*
- *"When the final connection stabilizes, the ancient evil will force its way through."*

### Parting Words
- *"This task will test not only your strength but your coordination and will."*
- *"Remember that you carry divine essence - it allows you to interact with these planar energies in ways mere mortals cannot."*
- *"Waterdeep's fate, and perhaps that of the Sword Coast, rests in your hands."*
- *"Complete this task, and return for my divine blessing. After that, you will attain the power needed to confront Fazrahl directly."*
- *"Go now, the portal has begun to appear within the city."*
