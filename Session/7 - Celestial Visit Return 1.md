# Celestial Realm Return - Tyr

## Return to Tyr

### Tyr's Reception
- Tyr rises from his throne as the party returns, his blind justice-seeing eyes somehow reflecting their accomplishment
- *"The scales of justice have begun to balance once more. I have felt the shift across the planes."*
- *"Fazrahl's essence has been diminished by your actions. The corruption of Athkatla's leylines no longer feeds his stolen divinity."*
- *"You have struck the first meaningful blow against this usurper. Order begins to reassert itself where chaos reigned."*
- *"Your divine spark grows stronger - I can see it burning within each of you."*

### To Yrsa
- Tyr turns his attention specifically to Yrsa
- *"Yrsa, faithful servant. You have carried my banner into darkness and emerged victorious."*
- *"Your dedication to justice has never wavered, even when faced with divine corruption."*
- *"Know that your actions in Athkatla have been recorded in the Halls of Justice. The celestial courts speak your name with honor."*
- *"Continue to be my hand in the mortal realm, for there are few I trust more with such responsibility."*

### The Divine Blessing
- Tyr extends his hand, a radiant light emanating from his palm
- *"You have all proven worthy of greater divine power. Kneel and receive my blessing."*
- As the party kneels, a surge of divine energy flows through them
- *"I strengthen the divine essence within you. Feel your connection to the celestial realms grow more profound."*
- Each character feels a new power awakening within them, their divine essence becoming more vibrant and responsive
- *"This blessing is but one step in your journey. Another awaits you after your next trial."*

### The Path Forward
- *"Though weakened, Fazrahl grows desperate. Desperation makes even gods dangerous."*
- *"To face him directly, you will need the blessing of one more deity after completing their divine task."*
- *"The cosmic balance requires this threefold blessing - only then will your divine spark be strong enough to challenge Fazrahl's stolen divinity."*
- *"Several deities have observed your progress and each offers a different path forward."*
- *"Which divine ally do you wish to consult next? Their domain will shape both your next blessing and the nature of your challenge."*
- *"After this next challenge, one final trial will prepare you for the confrontation with Fazrahl himself."*

## [Selected Deity]'s Guidance

### Divine Revelation
- *"Fazrahl's desperation has manifested in several threats across Faer√ªn, but one stands out as most urgent to my domain."*
- *"While Mystra might have directed you to the arcane disruptions in Baldur's Gate, and Gond to the corrupted constructs in Lantan..."*
- *"I sense the greatest immediate threat is in Waterdeep, where the barriers between planes grow thin."*
- *"This particular challenge aligns with my divine powers, allowing me to offer you specific aid that other deities could not provide for this task."*

### The Planar Threat
- *"Fazrahl has opened a tear between planes in the heart of Waterdeep - a city of splendor now facing abyssal horror."*
- *"Demons and devils pour through, caring not for their ancient enmities in service to his chaos."*
- *"This is both attack and distraction - while mortals suffer, he feeds on their pain and terror to restore what he has lost."*

### The Portal Crisis
- *"Fazrahl has created a nexus of planar convergence within Waterdeep's Trade Ward."*
- *"The portal draws power from five anchor points spread throughout the city - corrupted fountains that once channeled the city's protective magic."*
- *"At the heart of this chaos stands Moryx, a pit fiend general who has unified the demonic and devilish forces under Fazrahl's banner."*
- *"With each passing hour, the portal grows more stable. If it becomes permanent, Waterdeep will fall, and the material plane will face an invasion unlike any before."*

### The Divine Solution
- *"My divine domain gives me unique insight into this particular threat. I can guide you in ways others could not."*
- *"To close the portal, you must purify the five anchor points while contending with the fiendish forces."*
- *"Each anchor requires the essence of a specific element to be cleansed - water from the Ethereal Sea, fire from the Forge of Creation, earth from the Foundations of Order, air from the Breath of Life, and spirit from the Heart of Faith."*
- *"These essences must be gathered during the battle itself - extracted from defeated fiendish commanders who carry them unknowingly."*
- *"Once all five essences are collected, you must bring them to the portal's core while Moryx still lives."*
- *"There, you will face both Moryx and the unstable energies of the collapsing portal as you complete the ritual of sealing."*
- *"Should you succeed, the portal will implode, banishing the remaining fiends and striking another blow against Fazrahl's divinity."*

### Parting Words
- *"This task will test not only your strength but your coordination and will."*
- *"Remember that you carry divine essence - it allows you to interact with these planar energies in ways mere mortals cannot."*
- *"Waterdeep's fate, and perhaps that of the Sword Coast, rests in your hands."*
- *"Complete this task, and return for my divine blessing. After that, only one more trial will stand between you and the power needed to confront Fazrahl directly."*
- *"Go now, with my blessing and that of Tyr before me."*
