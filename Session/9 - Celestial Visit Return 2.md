# Celestial Realm Return - Tyr

## Return to Tyr

### Tyr's Reception
- Tyr rises from his throne as the party returns, his blind justice-seeing eyes reflecting their haste and resolve
- "The scales of justice have begun to balance once more. I have felt the shift across the planes."
- "Fazrahl's essence has been diminished by your actions. The corruption of Athkatla's leylines no longer feeds his stolen divinity."
- "You have struck the first meaningful blow against this usurper. Order begins to reassert itself where chaos reigned."
- "Your divine spark continues to grow — I can see it yearning to reach its full potential within each of you."

### The Growing Legend
- "Word of your deeds spreads across Faerûn like wildfire. 'The Saviors of Verbobonc,' 'The Heroes of Athkatla,' and now 'The Chosen of the Realms' — these names echo in taverns and noble courts alike."
- "This recognition strengthens divine power. As mortals speak your names with reverence, your capacity to channel celestial energy grows."
- "The threads of destiny binding you to the divine realms are reinforced by each soul who believes in your purpose."
- "This connection to the mortal realm's collective faith makes you uniquely suited to wield greater divine power against Fazrahl."

### To Yrsa
- Tyr's gaze shifts to Yrsa as the divine light around him intensifies
- "Among these chosen heroes, each plays a unique role in this divine struggle."
- "Yrsa, faithful servant. You have carried my banner into darkness and emerged victorious."
- "Your dedication to justice has not wavered. Your actions in Athkatla are recorded in the Halls of Justice; the celestial courts speak your name with honor."
- "Continue to be my hand in the mortal realm. This charge remains with you until balance is restored."

### The Divine Blessing
- You have done well, your actions have weakened Fazrahl's hold on the stolen divinity of the Dawnfather, which have not yet settled into their new host. 
- Although he has the full power of a god, he is not yet infallable, and should you confront him in his new realm, you may yet defeat him and take the necessary steps to undo the damage he has caused.
- We have done all that we can without direct interference, although we still risk repercussions from the Allfather once he returns. 
- Apart you are strong. You have repeatededly overcome overwhelming odds and been granted worthy of ascending to demi godhood. Together you are more than the sum of your individual powers.
- Bow now to receive my blessing.

## Mystra's Revelation
- "When my previous form, Mystryl, was unmade, the Weave convulsed. Magic surged, then fell silent. Cities tumbled from the sky; oaths and wards unraveled. Yet although Mystryl was unmade, she was born of the weave and the weave was born of her, and through the divine prominence of the Allfather Ao, she was reborn as Mystra and rewove the Weave with new strictures, so such hubris would not threaten to end the world again."
- "Karsus failed because he grasped for the font of magic itself. No mortal—or godling—can bear the raw totality of the Weave. Mystryl severed his and her own apotheosis to save reality, and with that cut, his stolen divinity turned to stone within him."
- "Fazrahl is much more powerful than Karsus was before he stole the divine power of the mantle, and he did not reach for the Weave. He stole the Dawnfather’s mantle through the fearsome power of Guth’Bani which shears mantles — the divine raiment that makes a god a god, rather than binding magic. With a mantle to anchor him, he endures where Karsus shattered."
- "As you know, Guth’Bani was wrought in secret by Gond’s hand. Ao judged this a trespass upon the order of the heavens, and Gond was bound in the Fathomless Depths of The Spaceless Realm for a century of silence. His faithful did not know; they only felt the Quiet Forge—an age when genius dulled, designs stalled, and new wonders almost unheard of."
- "Know, too, the cost of the Dawnfather’s absence. Pelor, lord of the dawn, is the herald of first light across countless realms. Without his hand to kindle the chorus of day, dawns falter to ashen grey. Where light wanes, the green world withers. Crops fail, forests sicken, and only those sustained by dark powers or disciples of the weave who can bend magic to feed the leaf and seed—will endure the long night. This withering has already begun; you can taste it in the harvests, see it in the pallid fields, and mark it in the dimming of the firmament."
- Although what has transpired in these realms is unfathomable, the Allfather's presence is required for an even greater threat that promises to unravel reality itself if not attended to, but I must speak no further about such things. It is better he is not here, or we may not have been able to assist you as much as we already have.

### Mystra's Final Counsel
- "Fazrahl is weakened by your deeds. Strike while his stolen light is still unsettled, before it hardens into dominion you cannot break."
- "I feel his presence steeping in Hades, the Gray Wastes, where color and conviction are leeched from all things. If you have any affairs to resolve, now would be the time to do them."
- "Face him there, in the realm he now claims as his own, and his mantle will find no refuge. If you cast him down upon that soil, you can end him forever. "
