### The Divine Blessing
- You have done well, your actions have weakened Fazrahl's hold on the stolen divinity of the Dawnfather, which have not yet settled into their new host. 
- Although he has the full power of a god, he is not yet infallable, and should you confront him in his new realm, you may yet defeat him and take the necessary steps to undo the damage he has caused.
- We have done all that we can without direct interference, although we still risk repercussions from the Allfather once he returns. 
- Apart you are strong. You have repeatededly overcome overwhelming odds and been granted worthy of ascending to demi godhood. Together you are more than the sum of your individual powers.
- Bow now to receive my blessing.
