## Nessus Introduction (Read to Players)

*The air shimmers around you as your planar travel concludes. A wave of scorching heat washes over your body, followed immediately by a toxic, acrid taste filling your lungs. You've arrived in Nessus—the ninth and deepest layer of the Nine Hells, domain of Asmodeus himself.*

*Before you stretches a vast, seemingly endless ravine so deep that its bottom vanishes into darkness. The crimson sky above burns with unnatural light, occasionally torn by lightning that illuminates the silhouettes of winged fiends patrolling in the distance.*

*The ground beneath your feet radiates intense heat. This is not a place where mortals are meant to survive for long.*

**GM Note:** Characters take 1d6 fire damage every hour from the ground's heat unless they have fire resistance or protection.

### Player Options upon Arrival

1. **Survey your surroundings more carefully** - Allow players to make Perception checks to spot potential threats or paths forward
2. **Cast protective magic** - Spells like Endure Elements, Protection from Energy, or similar magic can mitigate environmental effects
3. **Look for shelter** - There may be areas where the environmental effects are less severe
4. **Begin descent toward the Serpent's Coil** - The most obvious path downward
5. **Attempt to contact a guide** - Characters with planar knowledge might know rituals to summon a potential guide

## The Serpent's Coil

### Read to Players

*Before you stretches the Serpent's Coil—a massive spiraling path that winds down the ravine wall like the coils of an enormous serpent. The path itself is formed from compressed ash and obsidian, with sections that glow red-hot. The walls "weep" a crimson substance that seems to whisper as you pass.*

*Plumes of brimstone occasionally erupt from fissures in the path, and you notice small alcoves in the walls. Further down, the path widens into what appear to be caverns filled with glittering crystals.*

## The Forgotten Outpost

### Read to Players

*Halfway down the ravine wall, you come upon a fortress of black iron and basalt. Unlike the rest of Nessus, this structure appears to have been violently abandoned. The outer walls are scorched and partially melted, while strange runic symbols glow with faint blue light along the floors.*

### Ominous Discovery

As players prepare to leave with the Divine Spark, they discover evidence that someone named Fazrahl has already visited the Sepulcher and extracted knowledge about the Divine Spark. Cryptic notes left behind suggest he knows of another such artifact—potentially a fourth spark that wasn't mentioned in previous lore. 

This could set up potential future quests as the players must:
1. Discover who Fazrahl is
2. Learn about the rumored fourth spark
3. Determine what plans Fazrahl has for this knowledge
4. Potentially stop a catastrophic misuse of divine power

## Conclusion

Having overcome the trials of Nessus and claimed the Divine Spark, the characters now possess one of the most powerful artifacts in the multiverse. Their escape from the Nine Hells will be challenging, but the Spark's power provides them with several advantages and options.

The knowledge they've gained about the Spark's purpose and the mysterious Fazrahl opens up numerous possibilities for future adventures. Whether they choose to guard the Spark, study its properties, return it to its rightful celestial owners, or use it for their own purposes, the consequences of their actions will echo throughout the planes.

And Moryx, though defeated, will eventually reform in the Abyss. His vendetta against Pamykos and now the entire party has only intensified, promising a future confrontation when the characters least expect it.
