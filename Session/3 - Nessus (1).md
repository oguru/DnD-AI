# Nessus

## Introduction (Read to Players)

*The air shimmers around you as your planar travel concludes. A wave of scorching heat washes over your body, followed by a toxic, acrid taste filling your lungs. You've arrived in Nessus—the ninth and deepest layer of the Nine Hells, domain of Asmodeus himself.*

*Before you stretches a vast ravine so deep that its bottom vanishes into darkness. The crimson sky burns with unnatural light, occasionally torn by lightning that illuminates the silhouettes of winged fiends in the distance.*

**GM Note:** Characters take 1d6 fire damage every hour from the ground's heat unless they have fire resistance. Additionally, they must make a DC 15 Constitution save every hour or take 2d10 acid damage from the toxic air.

### Player Options upon Arrival

1. **Survey your surroundings more carefully**
   - DC 15 Perception check reveals a winding path down the ravine wall known as the Serpent's Coil
   - Success by 5 or more also spots distant structures along the ravine walls and potential devil patrols

2. **Cast protective magic**
   - Spells like Protection from Energy or similar magic mitigate environmental damage
   - Endure Elements (if available in your campaign) negates both damage types
   - Creative combinations of spells may provide full protection at DM discretion

3. **Begin descent toward the Serpent's Coil**
   - The most direct route to your destination
   - Initial descent is steep but manageable (no check required unless rushing)
   - First signs of the weeping walls become visible after about 30 minutes of descent

## The Serpent's Coil

*A massive spiraling path winds down the ravine wall like the coils of an enormous serpent. The path is formed from compressed ash and obsidian, with sections that glow red-hot. The walls "weep" a crimson substance that whispers as you pass.*

*Plumes of brimstone occasionally erupt from fissures in the path, and you notice small alcoves in the walls.*

## Transition to the Crystal Cavern

*As you continue down the Serpent's Coil, the path widens dramatically into an enormous crystal-lined cavern. Light refracts through thousands of crimson and obsidian formations, casting eerie shadows across what appears to be—impossibly—a marketplace of some kind. The sounds of bartering, arguing, and occasional shrieks echo off the crystalline walls.*

### The Crystal Cavern Devil Market

*An expansive cavern stretches before you, every surface lined with jutting crystals of blood-red and midnight black. The central area has been cleared to form a bazaar where devils of various forms hawk wares both mundane and horrific. Cages containing squirming souls, bottles of strange essences, and weapons forged from nightmares are displayed prominently.*

*As you enter, several nearby devils turn, their eyes narrowing as they hiss, "Fleshlings... mortals... new slaves..." The marketplace doesn't stop, but you feel many eyes tracking your movements.*

### Jizzrek's Surprise Appearance

As you converse with one of the devil vendors, a small figure suddenly materializes beside you, causing the devil merchant to recoil in shock and anger.

*The merchant's clawed hand lashes out to strike the diminutive newcomer—a curious being with features that blend goblin and gnome characteristics wrapped in tattered robes adorned with faded holy symbols.*

*Without even looking at his attacker, the small figure simply raises one finger. The devil freezes mid-strike, its expression transforming from rage to abject terror. The merchant whimpers, trembling visibly before falling to its knees in submission.*

*"Jizzrek have business to discuss with best customers, yeh yeh," the small figure says to you, ignoring the cowering devil. His voice carries an unexpected resonance, ancient power hidden beneath his unassuming appearance.*

*The surrounding devils give Jizzrek a wide berth, many averting their eyes or making subtle warding gestures as they hurry past.*

*"Special friends need supplies for journey?"*

   - Infernal script on bottle warns "payment comes due"

If conversed with, Jizzrek offers cryptic advice about the Vault: *"Light never meant to be in cage, yeh yeh. But some things too dangerous for roam free. What wait for mortals older than hells themselves. Remember, not all prisons hold criminals—some contain victims, yeh yeh."*

#### Balzog's Information
If approached and offered blood (at least 1d8 HP worth), Balzog becomes surprisingly forthcoming:

*"Ah, the taste of mortal essence! So much more vibrant than the stale souls we usually get down here."* He licks his lips, blood staining his tusks. *"Tell me, what knowledge do you seek?"*

He leans closer. *"The only unexplored place left is the Hall of Sanctity, long protected by ancient celestial magic and impenetrable by the inhabitants of this realm. We devils cannot enter—the wards burn our essence. But you... you might pass through."*

For additional blood (another 1d8 HP), he reveals:
- The Vault houses one of the fundamental forces of creation
- A fallen paladin of the sun god has been showing unusual interest in the Vault recently
- Agents of the Celestine Dawn have been making deals with devils for access to certain areas of Nessus
- There are rumors of a werebear warband led by a powerful female berserker operating somewhere in the vicinity of the Charred Fields

### Transition to the Forgotten Outpost
*After leaving the Devil Market, the Serpent's Coil continues downward. Hours later, you spot a structure built into the ravine wall ahead—a fortress of black iron and basalt. Unlike the chaotic architecture of most hellish structures, this one shows signs of methodical design, though it appears to have been abandoned.*

# The Forgotten Outpost

Halfway down the ravine wall stands a fortress of black iron and basalt. Unlike the rest of Nessus, this structure appears abandoned. The outer walls are scorched and partially melted, with fiery lava channels visible through reinforced barriers along the perimeter. Strange blue runes glow along the floors, providing an eerie contrast to the hellish red glow from outside.

The temperature inside is unnaturally cold compared to the hellish heat outside. As you enter from the northern entrance, you can see a large circular chamber in the center of the outpost containing what appears to be a damaged teleportation circle.

## Key Areas

### Central Chamber (Portal Chamber)
A massive circular chamber dominates the center of the outpost. Inside, an inactive portal is inlaid with strange blue runes that occasionally pulse with faint power. Two large crystalline structures float to the north and south of the portal, though both appear dormant and misaligned.

- DC 16 Arcana check reveals the portal was an ancient gateway connecting to other locations within Nessus
- The portal appears to be powered by the floating crystals, which have shifted out of alignment
- The crystals themselves seem to require power from the facility's lava channels to function

### East Wing (Warden's Archives)
This chamber contains rows of shelves filled with scrolls and tomes, most crumbling with age. A central desk bears the insignia of the Order of Stygian Flames, and the walls are lined with star charts and intricate diagrams of the portal mechanism.

- Heavily trapped - DC 15 Perception to spot pressure plates and tripwires
- Failed checks trigger flame jets (2d6 fire damage) or poison darts (2d4 poison damage)
- Safe containing Warden's Journal - DC 14 to pick, DC 15 to disable traps:
  - Notes about crystal alignment procedures
  - Password to disable sentient armour "Asmodeus Ascendant"
  - Password "Mercy is weakness, glory eternal" for Vault wards
  - Warnings about the "hostile nature of their empowerment" pushing crystals out of alignment
  - Diagrams showing how the lava channels power the floating crystals

### West Wing (Armory & Sentient Weapon)
This chamber contains weapon racks and abandoned devil armor. Four animated suits of armor stand motionless on pedestals, and a lone weapon floats in a containment field at the center.

- Heavily trapped - DC 15 Perception to spot pressure plates and tripwires
- Failed checks trigger flame jets (2d6 fire damage) or poison darts (2d4 poison damage)
- Four Animated Armor (dormant until sentient weapon is approached)
- Sentient axe weapon requires blood payment to attune
- DC 15 Arcana to safely approach the weapon without activating guardians
- Knowing passphrase "Asmodeus Ascendant" pacifies the guardians

### Combat Encounter: Awakened Guardians
When the party approaches the sentient weapon, the four suits of armor activate simultaneously unless pacified with the passphrase. They move with unnatural speed and coordinate their attacks with military precision.

**Encounter Difficulty:** Medium-Hard for Level 16
**XP:** 8,000 (2,000 each)

#### Enhanced Animated Armor (4)
*Large construct, unaligned*
- **AC:** 18 (natural armor)
- **HP:** 95 each
- **Speed:** 40 ft.
- **Multiattack:** Makes two slam attacks
- **Slam:** +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., 2d8+5 force damage

- **Hellfire Core:** When reduced to 0 HP, explodes in a 10-foot radius (DC 16 Dex save, 3d10 fire damage)
- **Magic Resistance:** Advantage on saving throws against spells

**Resolution:**
- The passphrase "Asmodeus Ascendant" immediately deactivates all armors

### Northwest Tower (The Forge)
A massive forge dominates this chamber, connected to lava channels that run throughout the fortress. The mechanisms appear inactive, and through a cracked wall, you can see that the main lava flow has been blocked by a hardened obsidian formation outside the tower.

- Exterior Climb - DC 16 Athletics to climb outside the tower to the blockage
- Removing blockage requires appropriate tools or magic
- Interior Forge Controls - Series of levers and wheels that must be operated in sequence:
  - DC 15 Investigation to understand the mechanism
  - DC 14 Strength to turn the primary wheel
  - Proper sequence redirects lava flow to power channels
- Special Containers - Heat-resistant vessels designed to collect lava safely
  - Can be found on shelves near the forge
  - Required to manually empower the crystals

### South Wing (Observation Deck)
This elevated platform contains sophisticated astronomical devices aimed at the distant stars. Charts and maps cover the walls, with specific markings highlighting the proper alignment of the portal crystals.

- Star Charts - DC 16 Intelligence check to interpret:
  - Reveal correct alignment positions for the crystals
  - Show connection between stellar positions and portal destinations
- Far-seeing Device - DC 15 Arcana to operate:
  - View the Vault of Entombed Light in the distance
  - Spot devil patrols up to 1 mile away

### East Side Chambers (Containment Cells)
Small rooms line the corridors, most empty but some bearing marks of escape attempts. Strange wards glow faintly on some doors.

- Contains Pizryk, an imprisoned imp willing to guide you

## Main Objective: Activate the Portal

1. **Explore the East Wing**
   - Find the Warden's notes about crystal alignment and portal activation

5. **Align and Empower the Crystals**
   - Move the floating crystals to their correct positions

6. **Activate the Portal**
   - Once crystals are aligned and powered, the portal activates
   - Generates a stable gateway to the Charred Fields
   - Demon Invasion
   - Pyre hears in his mind that the forces of Mephistopheles has found him.
   - One has to stay to keep crystals aligned, and the other to pour the molten lava on the crystals
   - Everyone else has to battle the waves of enemies

When the portal is finally activated, its blue-red energy creates a stable gateway. Stepping through, you emerge on the far side of the Charred Fields.

### Transition to the Charred Fields

*You find yourself transported to a similar looking portal, and nearby an aged demon shuffles towards you.*

"Transportation through the nexus channels requires payment, what offering do you provide?"

Fight and he calls reinforcements or he accepts and shuffles off.

### Combat Encounter: The Nexus Warden

The aged demon reveals himself as a Nexus Warden, his withered form belying deadly speed and arcane might.

*From the observation deck, you can see your next destination—a vast plateau of black glass jutting from the ravine wall ahead. Devils patrol the surface, and strange towers collect something glowing from the glass itself. This must be the Charred Fields that separate the outpost from the Vault of Entombed Light.*

## The Charred Fields

*A massive plateau stretches horizontally from the ravine wall. There are roaring flames erupting from some parts of the land, and other parts contain crevasses of blue swirling light, occasionally revealing glimpses of tormented souls trapped within. The air above is filled with swirling ash that occasionally forms into humanoid shapes before dispersing.*

*Scattered across the field are towering mechanical structures resembling metallic plants, each collecting a glowing essence that flows through transparent tubes toward a central facility in the distance. Devil overseers patrol between towers, while insect-like constructs skitter across the surface.*

### Transition to the Vault

*After navigating the treacherous Charred Fields, you finally approach your destination. Unlike the hellish architecture surrounding it, this structure appears to be of celestial origin — a once-radiant temple now corrupted by eons in hell. According to your research, this is the Vault of Entombed Light, a structure that predates even Asmodeus's rule of Nessus—a place where something of immense power was sealed away rather than destroyed.*
