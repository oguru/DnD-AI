# Return to Verbobonc - Reviving Old Bum

## Arrival in the Rebuilt City

As you approach Verbobonc, the sight that greets you is both familiar and transformed. Where once stood ruins from the dragon's devastation, new buildings rise—some hastily constructed, others showing the careful craftsmanship of those determined to rebuild better than before. The walls have been reinforced, and you can see the scars of battle have been filled with stronger stone.

The guards at the gate recognize you immediately—word of the chosen of the realm has spread far and wide. They wave you through with grateful nods and calls of "Welcome home, champions!"

## Unexpected Reunions

### Spotting Dart
As you move through the crowded streets filled with refugees and rebuilding efforts, Okurak's keen eyes spot a familiar figure trying to blend into a group of displaced citizens near a relief station. **Dart**, the skinny, wheezy dwarf from his old crew, is hunched over and clearly attempting to remain inconspicuous.

When he realizes he's been spotted, his shoulders slump in defeat rather than fear. The usual cowardly demeanor is replaced by something resembling shame and desperate hope.

### Dart's Revelation
**Dart:** *[coughing and wheezing]* "Okurak... I... I know you have every reason to kill me, but please, just listen for a moment. I was never working for Fazrahl by choice."

**The Truth About Dart:**
- When Fazrahl performed the city-wide ritual to steal Pelor's power, the magical domination that had controlled Dart for years suddenly broke
- Fazrahl's transformation into a new divine entity severed his mental connections to his old pawns
- The ritual failed to affect Dart because he was neither strong enough nor innocent enough to be a viable target
- With the domination lifted, Dart was flooded with horrific memories of everything he'd been forced to do while under Fazrahl's control
- He fled Athkatla in terror and sought refuge here among the other displaced people

**Dart's Proof:** He still carries the **Celestine Dawn communication crystal** that Fazrahl used to give him orders, but it now shows only static and dead energy.

### Elderon's Appearance
As Dart finishes his explanation, a familiar voice calls out from behind a cart of supplies: "Ah, there you are. Right on schedule."

**Elderon Perfleet** emerges, looking older and more weathered than when you last saw him. His pocket watch ticks with an odd rhythm, and his eyes hold the weight of terrible knowledge.

**Elderon:** "I knew you'd come here—to save your friend. It's what you do. What you've always done across every timeline I've witnessed."

### Elderon's True Story
**Elderon's Revelation:**
- He's not from the past—he's from the future, the year 1880, where Fazrahl won and plunged the world into eternal darkness
- This is Timeline 848. He's the 848th version of himself to attempt to change history
- Each Elderon makes ONE small change, then uses a sleeping draught to skip forward and see the results
- When they wake, they find the new timeline's Elderon and share what they've learned
- None of the previous 847 attempts succeeded

**Previous Timeline Examples:**
- "Timeline 23: I stopped to tie my shoelace in front of a messenger, causing him to trip. He was delayed getting to the tavern, ended up sitting next to an off-duty city guard who was in a foul mood. They got into a fight, which led to the messenger being arrested. This caused him to miss delivering crucial intelligence about a Celestine Dawn safe house, allowing them to escape a raid and regroup. Fazrahl still won, but it took three extra days."

- "Timeline 156: I deliberately dropped a coin in front of a street vendor, causing a small crowd to gather looking for it. This delayed a young paladin by exactly four minutes, which meant she arrived at the temple just as the evening bells were ringing instead of before. The sound reminded her of her sister's wedding, causing her to write a letter home instead of staying late to study. Because she wasn't there, she didn't discover the hidden passage the cultists were using. Fazrahl's ritual succeeded two hours earlier."

- "Timeline 334: I convinced a baker to try a new recipe by claiming it was popular in my homeland. The baker made honey cakes instead of regular bread that day. A hungry street child stole one of these instead of a regular loaf, and the honey gave him enough energy to run further when fleeing. He witnessed a secret meeting he otherwise would have missed and reported it to the wrong authorities—who were already corrupted. This led to the good authorities being purged earlier. Fazrahl won by an even larger margin."

- "Timeline 567: I helped an old woman carry her groceries, which put her in such a good mood she gave extra alms to a beggar. That beggar was actually a disguised Celestine Dawn agent gathering information. The extra coins allowed him to bribe a dock worker for ship schedules. This intelligence led to them intercepting the wrong ship—a decoy—while Fazrahl's real reinforcements arrived unopposed."

**What He Won't Reveal:**
"I can tell you what the others tried, but I cannot tell you what I changed in this timeline. If I do, it might undo the very thing that's made you different from all the others. All I can say is... you've shown something the previous 847 versions never did."

### The Alliance
Both Dart and Elderon want to help, but in different ways:

**Dart's Offer:**
- He knows Athkatla's layout and remaining Celestine Dawn operations from his dominated memories
- He wants to help rebuild and root out remaining cultists as penance
- "I can't undo what I was forced to do, but maybe I can help prevent it from happening to others."

**Elderon's Knowledge:**
- His multiversal pocket watch shows him echoes of failed timelines
- He can provide warnings about specific dangers they'll face
- "I've seen how this story ends 847 different ways. I pray this time will be different."

### The Choice
The party must decide whether to trust these unlikely allies, knowing their complex histories and the weight of their revelations.

## The Changed City

### The Bridgewalk District
- Where the Bridgewalk Tavern once stood, a memorial plaza has been erected
- A simple stone bears the names of all who fell during the dragon attack
- Old Bum's name is prominently carved: "Friend to All, Stranger to None"
- Fresh flowers are always present—the townspeople have not forgotten his sacrifice

### The Temple District
- The temples have been rebuilt with additional shrines dedicated to those who fell
- Arabella greets you warmly, mentioning that Ratan visits Old Bum daily
- She leads you to where Old Bum rests in the Temple of Helm's healing chambers

## Old Bum's Condition

### The Vigil
- Old Bum lies in a simple but comfortable bed, looking peaceful despite his coma
- His breathing is steady, but he shows no signs of consciousness
- Ratan sits beside him, reading aloud from various magical texts
- "I've tried everything I know," Ratan admits with frustration. "Healing magic, restoration spells... nothing reaches whatever realm his mind has wandered to."

### The Townspeople's Care
- A rotation of townspeople visit daily, bringing food and tending to his needs
- Children leave small gifts—turnips (his favorite), flowers, simple drawings
- "He saved us all," one elderly woman explains. "The least we can do is watch over him while he heals."

## Administering the Tincture

### Ratan
- "I have done countless hours of study, and have discovered that the tincture must be administered at sunset, when the veil between realms is thinnest, which is a problem now the sun never rises. I know not how we can bring him back under our current circumstances".
- If the group finds a solution:
- "Old Bum must be positioned where he can see the sky, and whoever administers it must speak his true name. I know not his first name, but I traced his heritage back to a proud clan of turnip farmers of the clan McGee. Other than this the trail ran cold." (Turnips McGee)

### The Ritual
- Arabella helps move Old Bum to the temple's rooftop garden
- When you carefully pour the tincture between his lips
- For a moment, nothing happens...
- Then his eyes begin to flutter, and a soft golden glow emanates from his skin

### The Awakening
- Old Bum's eyes open slowly, confused and disoriented
- "Did... did we win?" are his first words
- When he sees all of you gathered around him, tears well in his eyes
- "I dreamed I was in the most beautiful garden... there were turnips the size of my belly, and taters..." he pauses for a second and his eyes go wide "... and taternips! Oh how I long for a taternip! Say... do any of you have any turnips?"

## Old Bum's Revelation

### The Divine Connection
- "While I was... away... I think I met someone. An old gardener who said he'd been waiting for me."
- "He told me my real name, but said I should choose what I want to be called now that I'm back"

### His Choice
- "I think... I'd like to be called Nip. It feels right somehow."
- "The gardener — I think it might have been Chauntea herself — she said I have work to do"
- "Something about tending to the seeds of hope that y'all have planted, maybe when we're all done I can tend to taternip seeds"

## The Town's Celebration

### Spontaneous Festival
- Word spreads quickly that Old Bum (now Nip) has awakened
- The entire city erupts in celebration
- Impromptu feasts appear as people bring food from their homes
- Musicians emerge from every corner, and dancing fills the streets. You see the members of the Bodacious Board of Bards including Skug, and Barr and his band The Bardacious Bunch with Flip (Hulusi), Terrin and Hulu.
- Music breaks out and people invite you to feast and play music with them

### The Great Tavern Brawl
- As the evening progresses and ale flows freely, Jambaroni (still bitter about his arena defeat who had been sitting in the shadows) calls out from across the crowded square
- "Anyone fancy a proper celebration brawl? No weapons, no magic, just good old-fashioned fun!"
- The crowd cheers, and soon a circle forms in the town square

**The Combatants:**
- **Nip (Old Bum)** slides between people's legs, giggling as he attempts to slap their balls with surprising agility
- **Skug the Dwarf** mostly grunts and swings wild haymakers, his prison camp training evident in his surprisingly effective brawling style
- **Jambaroni** wields a large fish he grabbed from a nearby vendor's stall, attempting dramatic slapping maneuvers
- **Gronk the Half-Orc** flexes menacingly but keeps tripping over Nip, who treats this like a game
- **Murrinflurp the Wizard** attempts "tactical combat" but mostly just flails about ineffectively
- **Puzz and Guzz** work as a team until they accidentally punch each other

**Sample Brawl Actions:**
- Jambaroni charges Pamykos wielding his wet fish, shouting "This is for the arena humiliation!" but slips on spilled ale
- Nip crawls under tables and between legs, popping up to slap balls at crucial moments
- Skug communicates entirely through grunts but somehow coordinates surprisingly effective team attacks
- Gronk attempts to intimidate people but ends up in a tickle fight with Nip
- Murrinflurp tries to cast "non-magical spells" by shouting random arcane words while throwing turnips

**The Environment:**
- Tables and benches become impromptu obstacles and weapons
- Spilled ale makes the cobblestones treacherously slippery
- The crowd cheers and throws harmless objects (bread, flowers, more turnips)
- Musicians continue playing, adjusting the tempo to match the chaos

**Results:**
- Everyone ends up laughing and covered in ale, mud, and various food items
- Jambaroni finally admits they are the stronger group and they all show their respect with nods and shoulder slapping
- Nip is declared the unofficial winner for "creative use of dangle slapping tactics"
- The brawl ends with everyone collapsed in exhausted, drunken laughter

### Celebration Fare and Mystical Libations

As the festivities continue, grateful townspeople bring out their most prized magical concoctions for the heroes who saved their city. Old Garrick, the town's veteran barkeeper, grins and announces the evening's special selection:

"Right then, heroes! Tonight's libations are on the house - our gift to you! We have:

**Eldritch Wine Chaotic** - A shimmering purple wine that swirls with otherworldly energy; roll 3d10000 on the Net Libram d10k Wild Surge table and choose which of the 3 effects occurs! *One per person only!*

**Raven's Reward Effects:**
[Consumables by Rarity](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cscj9c_eSElaxskotQoHCRfnh26J5PID4AQz09Qjw0E/edit?gid=1172490832#gid=1172490832)

6. **Enhanced Senses** (+2 to Perception) for 2 hours - "I can hear Skug thinking in grunts"


**Ratan's Riddle Rolls** - Sweet pastries that whisper riddles when bitten; answer correctly for inspiration, answer wrong and learn something unexpected about our fair city!". If incorrect riddle answer, wild magic surge:

**Riddle 1:** *"I have streets but no traffic, I have buildings but no people live in them, I have water but no fish swim in it. What am I?"*
- **Answer:** A map
- **Right Answer Fact:** "The original city plans for Verbobonc included a secret underground tunnel system connecting all major buildings - most of it was never built, but some sections still exist!"

**Riddle 2:** *"I grow stronger when shared, weaker when hoarded, I can topple kingdoms yet cost nothing to give. What am I?"*
- **Answer:** Trust (or Hope)
- **Right Answer Fact:** "Verbobonc's city motto used to be 'Prosperity Through Cheese' until a very serious political incident involving moldy cheddar 100 years ago!"

**Riddle 3:** *"I have keys but no locks, I have space but no room, you can enter but not go inside. What am I?"*
- **Answer:** A keyboard (or musical instrument)
- **Right Answer Fact:** "The Bridgewalk Tavern was originally built as a temple to a forgotten god of hospitality - that's why the ale always tastes slightly blessed!"

**Riddle 4:** *"The more you take away from me, the bigger I become. What am I?"*
- **Answer:** A hole
- **Right Answer Fact:** "There's an ancient gnoll living in the city's main well - she's actually quite friendly and pays one shiny coin per year as rent!"

**Riddle 5:** *"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears, I have no body but come alive with the wind. What am I?"*
- **Answer:** An echo
- **Right Answer Fact:** "The city's bell tower has a hidden chamber where the original city charter is kept - it's written entirely in limerick form because the founding mayor was a frustrated poet!"

### Ratan's Joy
- Ratan watches the brawl with amusement, embracing Nip afterwards with tears in his eyes
- "I never gave up hope, old friend. Welcome back to the world of the living."

### Gifts and Gratitude
- The townspeople shower you with gifts: preserved foods, crafted items, family heirlooms

## Nip's New Purpose

### The Awakened Gardener
- Nip reveals he can now sense the spiritual health of plants and people
- He wants to help rebuild not just Verbobonc's buildings, but its spirit
- "I've seen what despair can do, and what hope can overcome"

### The Turnip Garden
- Nip asks to start a community garden where Old Bum's memorial stands
- "Let something good grow from the place where I nearly ended"
- The townspeople immediately volunteer to help

### A Parting Gift
- Before you leave, Nip gives you each a small turnip seed
- "Plant these when you face your darkest hour. Sometimes the simplest things carry the greatest magic"
- The seeds have a faint magical aura—they will grow instantly when planted with genuine hope

## Pyre's Family Quest (Optional)

### The Nobleman's Grave
If Pyre chooses to pursue his family history, his investigation leads him to Baldur's Gate and the Alminston family crypt in the Upper City cemetery. There, he finds the weathered gravestone of **Penford Alminston**, dead these 29 years. The inscription reads: *"Beloved father and devoted to Embria of the Endless Flame - May they reunite in whatever realm love transcends death."*

### The Fire Genasi's Tale
At the graveyard, Pyre encounters an elderly fire genasi tending to nearby graves. When she sees Pyre's necklace, her eyes widen with recognition.

*"That name... I knew your father, child. Penford was a good man who loved beyond the bounds of his world. Your mother, Embria, was no mere djinni - she was nobility of the Efreet courts. Their love affair scandalized both realms."*

*"When you were born, her sect demanded her return. She refused, so they sent an Efreet lord to drag her back in chains. Your father died trying to protect her. She left you that necklace - your true name in the Ignan script - hoping you'd one day be strong enough to find her."*

### The Rescue (Quick Resolution)
If Pyre wishes to pursue this immediately:

**The Portal:** Ratan can open a brief gateway to the Plane of Fire using his enhanced magical abilities gained from the recent divine events.

**The Confrontation:** Pyre finds his mother imprisoned by **Efreet Lord Qadesh** in the Brass City. The Efreet, impressed by Pyre's divine power and noble bearing, offers a simple challenge: *"Prove your worth in single combat, and I will release her. Your divine fire burns differently than ours - let us see if it burns brighter."*

**The Victory:** After a brief but intense battle (which Pyre, empowered by divine energy, can handle), Qadesh yields with grudging respect. *"You have grown beyond what either realm expected. Take your mother - you have earned her freedom through strength, not birthright."*

### The Reunion
**Embria** appears as a being of living flame and starlight, her joy at seeing her son overwhelming. *"My little spark... you've become a bonfire that could light the heavens themselves. Your father would be so proud."*

**Her Gift:** She bestows upon Pyre his true elemental name and a blessing of the Plane of Fire: Chaotic Djinni Fury.

**The Choice:** She offers to stay in the Material Plane now that she's free, or Pyre can visit her in the Plane of Fire after his divine mission is complete. Either way, the family is reunited.
