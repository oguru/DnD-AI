# The All-Father Ao

## The Brief Return
- The air stills, and a silence older than gods presses close. A single mote of starlight flowers into a towering presence.
- "The fractures have ceased their spreading. For the first time in eons, I am no longer needed to hold reality's seams together across infinite failing timelines."
- "I have returned because the cycle is broken. Eight hundred and forty-seven realities no longer scream in endless defeat. The temporal wounds heal."

## The Measure of Mortals
- His gaze pierces each of you, and in it race your entire lives—first breath to this breath—laid bare.
- "I see the line of your days across all timelines. What took eight hundred and forty-eight attempts to achieve, you have accomplished through something no previous iteration possessed."
- "You learned what power could not teach: that small kindnesses matter more than grand gestures, that unity born of difference is stronger than uniformity, that hope shared is hope multiplied."
- "You have been tested not just by me, but by the weight of 847 failed realities. You have been found worthy."

### The Weight of Infinity
- Ao gestures, and reality fractures around you. For a moment, you see glimpses of the 847 failed timelines—worlds where you fell, where darkness won, where hope died.
- **Each character makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18):**
  - **Success**: You gain profound insight into the patterns of failure and success. You understand how to prevent similar catastrophes in the future. (Gain a permanent +1 to Wisdom and advantage on the next major decision you make)
  - **Failure**: The weight of infinite suffering temporarily overwhelms you. You are stunned for 1 minute as you process the scope of what you've prevented. (But gain inspiration for overcoming this mental trial)

### The Mirror of Truth
- Ao conjures mirrors of starlight before each of you. In them, you see yourselves as you appeared in the worst timeline—corrupted, fallen, everything you swore never to become.
- **Each character makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 16):**
  - **Success**: You firmly reject this dark reflection and affirm your true nature. Your sense of self is strengthened. (Gain advantage on saves against charm, fear, and possession effects for the next year)
  - **Failure**: You're shaken by how close you came to that fate. (Disadvantage on the next major moral choice, but if you choose correctly despite this, gain double inspiration)

- "Your legend grows beyond a single timeline. I decree that you may remain as demigods, wardens and protectors of the mortal realms, should you will it."

## The Choice of the Dawn
- "One thread remains unbound: the dawn. The mantle of the Dawnfather lies wounded. If you desire, I will bless one among you with the Dawn's essence."
- "That soul will ascend to take Pelor's seat, rekindling first light and restoring the great order of day. The cost is real, the charge eternal."

### Shared Vision of the Dawn
- Ao extends his hand, and suddenly all of you experience what it would be like to bear the Dawn mantle.
- You feel the weight of every sunrise across infinite worlds, the responsibility for all light and growth, the eternal duty to kindle hope in darkness.
- **Each character makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 20):**
  - **Success**: You understand the full scope of the responsibility but feel you could bear it if needed. (If you choose to take the mantle, you gain additional benefits)
  - **Failure**: The overwhelming nature of eternal responsibility leaves you shaken. You understand why gods sometimes go mad from their duties.

### Divine Debate
- Ao steps back. "The choice is yours to make together. Speak freely—even gods must sometimes counsel with their peers."
- This is an opportunity for the party to discuss, debate, and even argue about who (if anyone) should take the Dawn mantle.
- **Skill checks during discussion:**
  - **Persuasion**: Convince others of your viewpoint about who should (or shouldn't) take the mantle
  - **Insight**: Read the true feelings of your companions about this monumental decision
  - **Religion**: Understand the theological implications of the choice for the cosmic order

### The Sunrise Test (If Someone Volunteers)
- If a character volunteers to become the Dawn-Bearer, Ao nods solemnly.
- "Then you must prove you can bear what eternity demands. Face these trials, and the mantle shall be yours."

**Trial 1 - The First Light (Constitution save DC 18):**
- You must kindle the first sunrise in a dead world. Feel the strain of channeling pure creation energy.
- Success: You successfully bring dawn to the lifeless realm
- Failure: The effort nearly breaks you, but your determination sees you through (gain 1 level of exhaustion but continue)

**Trial 2 - The Endless Vigil (Wisdom save DC 19):**
- Experience a century of mornings in an instant—every dawn you'll ever kindle, every world you'll ever light.
- Success: You maintain your sanity and sense of purpose across the eons
- Failure: The endless repetition nearly drives you to despair, but you find meaning in each individual sunrise

**Trial 3 - The Ultimate Sacrifice (Charisma save DC 20):**
- Understand that you'll watch every mortal you've ever loved age and die while you remain eternal and unchanging.
- Success: You accept this burden with grace, knowing your sacrifice serves the greater good
- Failure: The loneliness of immortality weighs heavily, but you choose duty over personal happiness

- "Choose with wisdom. Whether you stand as demigods together, or one bears the dawn alone, know this: the realms endure because you endured."

## Divine Choices and Artifacts
- Before his departure, Ao presents each character with choices that will shape their divine future.

### Divine Artifacts (Each Character Chooses)
- Ao opens his palm, revealing three artifacts tailored to each character's nature and potential role.
- **Investigation/Arcana checks (DC 15)** reveal the true properties and implications of each artifact.
- **Insight checks (DC 17)** help understand which artifact aligns best with your intended path.

*[DM: Customize 3 artifact choices per character based on their build, personality, and intended future role]*

### Realm Assignment (For Demigods)
- "If you choose to remain as demigods rather than ascend to full godhood, you must each select a domain of reality to protect and nurture."
- **Available Realms/Domains:**
  - **The Material Planes**: Protect mortal worlds from extraplanar threats
  - **The Feywild**: Maintain the balance between wonder and chaos
  - **The Shadowfell**: Ensure death and endings serve their proper purpose
  - **The Elemental Planes**: Keep the fundamental forces in harmony
  - **The Astral Sea**: Guard the pathways between worlds
  - **The Far Realm Boundaries**: Stand watch against cosmic horrors
  - **The Divine Realms**: Serve as intermediaries between gods and mortals

- **Skill checks to understand each realm:**
  - **History DC 15**: Understand the historical challenges of each domain
  - **Religion DC 17**: Grasp the theological significance of your choice
  - **Arcana DC 16**: Comprehend the magical implications of your guardianship

## Parting Decree
- The light contracts to a single star. "My vigil across broken realities is ended. The multiverse breathes freely for the first time since the first Elderon's desperate gambit."
- "Walk your chosen path with resolve. You have earned what no timeline before achieved: a future written by your own hands, not by the weight of infinite failures."
- "Where order is kept, my hand is steady; where it fails, I return. But for now... I rest, as you have given me that gift."

## If One Accepts the Dawn

### The Ascension
- As the chosen kneels, Ao unveils a shard of first light: a star-seed of dawn. Threads of aureate radiance spool from it, lacing through the hero's heart and name.
- Vision floods their senses: every sunrise you have ever witnessed, every dawn yet to be. The weight is vast, but the light teaches how to bear it.
- A corona forms behind you like a low horizon. Your shadow falls forward; your voice carries the warmth of morning.

### Divine Duties of the Dawn-Bearer (Choose 2-3 Focus Areas)
1. **Establishing Dawn Temples**: Build sanctuaries across the realms where the faithful can kindle sacred flames
2. **Cosmic Lighthouse**: Personally visit dying worlds to rekindle their suns and restore hope
3. **Training Dawn Clerics**: Teach mortal servants to carry dawn magic and spread light
4. **The Eternal War**: Fight cosmic entities that devour light and bring endless night
5. **The Morning Council**: Work with other gods to maintain cosmic balance
6. **Mortal Guidance**: Appear to heroes and leaders in their darkest hours

### Maintaining Mortal Connections
- **Charisma check (DC 18)**: How well do you maintain relationships with mortals over the centuries?
  - **Success**: You find ways to stay connected to mortality, perhaps through chosen champions or by walking among them in disguise
  - **Failure**: The burden of godhood slowly distances you from mortal concerns, though you never forget why you chose this path

### Consequences and Boons
- The next dawn across connected realms brightens by a subtle degree; near-world stars kindle truer. Farmers and sailors remark it without knowing why.
- The bearer may walk the mortal world in an avatar for seasons at a time, but must periodically return to the Celestial Halls to rekindle the chorus of day.
- Creatures of living shadow and despair will know the bearer by taste of light and be drawn to oppose them; the land and the faithful will answer in kind.
- The bearer can anoint stewards (once per moon) to keep sacred mornings in key places: sanctuaries that resist blight and withering.
- Oath of the Dawn (spoken by Ao): "Guard the first light. Kindled for all, owned by none. Let no crown claim the sunrise."

## If None Accept (For Now)
- Ao inclines his head. "So be it. The mantle waits, neither diminished nor impatient. Walk as wardens; when the hour ripens, the choice may be taken anew."
- He breathes upon the party a transient boon of morning: journeys begun at daybreak are favored by fortune and clear weather for a fortnight.

## Royal Recognition in Waterdeep
- Word of your deeds has reached the highest echelons of power. King Yagomir himself has requested your presence in the City of Splendors.
- The palace courtyard has been transformed for the occasion: banners bearing the arms of every major city you've saved flutter in precise formation, while noble houses vie for position to witness history.

### The Ceremony of Champions
- **The Royal Procession**: Trumpeters announce your arrival as you walk a carpet of deep blue velvet scattered with silver stars. Noble spectators line the path, some genuinely awed, others calculating political advantage.
- **The King's Address**: King Yagomir, resplendent in ceremonial armor, speaks from a raised dais:
  - "Before us stand those who have rewritten the fate of realms. When gods fell silent and darkness encroached, these champions answered with deeds that shall echo through the ages."
  - "Let it be recorded in the histories that mortals rose to heights divine, not through conquest or birthright, but through sacrifice and unity."

### Honors Bestowed
- **Titles Granted**:
  - "Defenders of the Dawn" (collectively)
  - "Saviors of the Coast" 
  - Each member receives a personal epithet based on their greatest deed (DM's choice based on campaign events)
- **Royal Privileges**:
  - Free passage and sanctuary in any city of the Lords' Alliance
  - Authority to muster aid in times of dire need
  - Access to the Royal Treasury for future endeavors (within reason)

### The Crown's Gifts (Interactive Choice)
- King Yagomir presents each character with a selection of ancient artifacts from the royal vaults.
- **Investigation checks (DC 16)** reveal the true properties of each artifact
- **History checks (DC 15)** uncover the legendary stories behind each item
- Each character must choose from 3 options tailored to their class and achievements

*[DM: Prepare 3 royal artifact options per character - these should be powerful but not game-breaking, representing the kingdom's gratitude]*

### The Political Undercurrent
- Several lords whisper among themselves about your divine status - some with reverence, others with concern about the balance of power
- **Insight checks (DC 14)** reveal the true intentions behind various nobles' approaches
- **Social Navigation Opportunities:**
  - **Lord Cassalanter** approaches with a "business proposition" (Deception DC 16 to see through his devil-cult connections)
  - **Lady Margaster** hints at marriage alliances for political advantage (Persuasion DC 15 to deflect gracefully)
  - **Mirt the Moneylender** offers genuine friendship and future support (no check needed - he's sincere)
  - **Several minor lords** seek audiences for various schemes and requests

### The Royal Challenge
- King Yagomir privately requests a demonstration of your divine power - but safely, without destroying his palace
- **Choose your approach:**
  - **Subtle Display**: Minor miracle or blessing (Performance DC 12)
  - **Impressive Show**: Significant but controlled power demonstration (Arcana DC 15 to keep it safe)
  - **Humble Refusal**: Politely decline while explaining the responsibility of power (Persuasion DC 16)
- The King's reaction depends on your choice and success

### Formal Reception
- Unlike Verbobonc's tavern revelry, this celebration features:
  - A grand banquet with seven courses, each representing a different saved city
  - Court musicians performing newly composed ballads about your exploits
  - Formal toasts where each lord present must publicly acknowledge your deeds
  - Political conversations disguised as pleasantries
  - The ceremony concludes with the lighting of a ceremonial brazier that will burn "until the dawn returns in full"

### Departure with Purpose
- As you leave the palace, the weight of royal recognition settles differently than Verbobonc's heartfelt gratitude
- The political implications of your new status are clear: the powerful now see you as peers rather than hired help
- The formal recognition marks a transition - you are no longer adventurers, but acknowledged leaders of a new age
