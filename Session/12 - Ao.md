# The All-Father Ao

## The Brief Return
- The air stills, and a silence older than gods presses close. A single mote of starlight flowers into a towering presence.
- "A narrow moment opens, and I walk it. Disturbances ripple across the skein of realms; I have returned to weigh them."

## The Measure of Mortals
- His gaze pierces each of you, and in it race your entire lives—first breath to this breath—laid bare.
- "I see the line of your days. Much I knew; more you have written beyond the designs of any power. You have been tested and found worthy."
- "Your legend grows. I decree that you may remain as demigods, wardens and protectors of the mortal realms, should you will it."

## The Choice of the Dawn
- "One thread remains unbound: the dawn. The mantle of the Dawnfather lies wounded. If you desire, I will bless one among you with the Dawn’s essence."
- "That soul will ascend to take Pelor’s seat, rekindling first light and restoring the great order of day. The cost is real, the charge eternal."
- "Choose with wisdom. Whether you stand as demigods together, or one bears the dawn alone, know this: the realms endure because you endured."

## Parting Decree
- The light contracts to a single star. "My moment closes. Walk your chosen path with resolve. Where order is kept, my hand is steady; where it fails, I return."

## If One Accepts the Dawn
- As the chosen kneels, Ao unveils a shard of first light: a star-seed of dawn. Threads of aureate radiance spool from it, lacing through the hero’s heart and name.
- Vision floods their senses: every sunrise you have ever witnessed, every dawn yet to be. The weight is vast, but the light teaches how to bear it.
- A corona forms behind you like a low horizon. Your shadow falls forward; your voice carries the warmth of morning.
- Consequences and boons:
  - The next dawn across connected realms brightens by a subtle degree; near-world stars kindle truer. Farmers and sailors remark it without knowing why.
  - The bearer may walk the mortal world in an avatar for seasons at a time, but must periodically return to the Celestial Halls to rekindle the chorus of day.
  - Creatures of living shadow and despair will know the bearer by taste of light and be drawn to oppose them; the land and the faithful will answer in kind.
  - The bearer can anoint stewards (once per moon) to keep sacred mornings in key places: sanctuaries that resist blight and withering.
- Oath of the Dawn (spoken by Ao): "Guard the first light. Kindled for all, owned by none. Let no crown claim the sunrise." 

## If None Accept (For Now)
- Ao inclines his head. "So be it. The mantle waits, neither diminished nor impatient. Walk as wardens; when the hour ripens, the choice may be taken anew."
- He breathes upon the party a transient boon of morning: journeys begun at daybreak are favored by fortune and clear weather for a fortnight.

## Return to Verbobonc: Old Bum’s Awakening
- The city bears fresh scars and stubborn hope. Banners from the fairs hang beside scaffolds; harvest stalls sell smaller, paler produce than last year.
- At the Temple where Lady Arabella now oversees relief and restitution, she greets you with tired grace: 
  - "You return as the city exhales. If there is one more mercy you intend, our halls will hold it."
- Ratan arrives with ledgers and half a dozen satchels of components, curiosity bright in his eyes: 
  - "Ah! The draught from your winter witch—Granny Flowers. I’ve tuned a lattice to dull any backlash if Pelor’s absence muddles the patient’s humors."

### The Rite
- Place: A sunlit nave cleared for healing. Arabella circles the cot with chalks of gold and white; Ratan inks a stabilizing sigil that hums at the edge of hearing.
- Steps:
  - Arabella: "By mercy, by justice: what was stolen we restore." She blesses the tincture.
  - Ratan: "Hold fast to self, old friend." He threads a soft abjuration through the draught.
  - The draught is administered; breath catches, then steadies. Color returns, first to the lips, then the cheeks. A faint dawn-glow ripples across the floor.
- Outcome:
  - Old Bum inhales sharply, eyes fluttering open. Confusion gives way to recognition. He asks for water… and a turnip.
  - Arabella smiles despite herself. "Welcome back. The city keeps stranger promises than prayers these days."
  - Ratan jots furiously. "Residual resonance… fascinating. If the Dawn returns in full, these convalescences will shorten across the Coast."

  Old Bum - "Oooh, I had the most wonderful dreams of turnips, and taters... and taturnips! Do... do you have any turnips, or taturnips?"

### Aftermath and Ties
- Arabella offers a quiet thanks and shares hard news: withering in nearby farms has begun; the faithful of Chauntea and Helm organize caravans and crop wards, but time is thin.
- Ratan provides a modest boon for the road: a day’s worth of warding sigils against despair (advantage on the first save against effects that sap hope or impose magical fatigue before your next long rest).
- Old Bum insists on walking outside. When the light touches his face, a simple peace settles over him. "Thought I’d slept through a lifetime. Turns out I woke up in yours."
- As you depart, church bells sound noon—dimmer than they should be. Somewhere beyond the clouds, the dawn waits to be mended or worn.
