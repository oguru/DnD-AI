-------------------
### The Guardian's Domain - Initial Encounter

*As you step through the final portal, reality settles into a vast spherical chamber that seems to exist outside normal space. The walls pulse with ever-shifting patterns of energy, and at the chamber's heart floats the Amulet Guardian.*

*This massive being appears as a constantly shifting form of pure chaos energy, its core containing the gleaming amulet you seek. Its "body" flows between states of matter - solid crystal one moment, crackling lightning the next, then pure void energy. Multiple arms of various elements extend and retract from its form, and its "face" is a kaleidoscope of geometric patterns that somehow convey ancient intelligence.*

*The chamber itself feels unstable, as if reality here is but a thin membrane ready to tear at any moment. Floating platforms of various materials orbit the central space where the Guardian hovers, providing precarious footing in this realm of chaos.*

*The Guardian's voice resonates not through sound but directly in your minds: "You who are many-yet-one, you seek that which holds reality in check. Prove your worth through mastery of chaos itself, or be scattered across the infinite planes."*

*With that, the battle chamber begins its first shift, and you feel reality starting to tear...*

**Initial Setup:**
- Guardian starts in center, 60ft up
- 6-8 floating platforms (15ft diameter) in orbital patterns
- Players can start on platforms of their choice
- First environment shift occurs after Guardian's first turn

Actions:
Multiattack: Two attacks with Reality Slash, one with Chaoe Beam/Reshape Reality

Reality Slash
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target
Hit: 3d12 + 8 force damage

Chaos Beam
Ranged Spell Attack: +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. 
Hit: 36 (8d8) force damage and the target must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is affected by a random effect from the Wild Magic Surge table (roll a d100 to determine the effect).

Reshape Reality (Recharge 5-6): The Chaos Weaver warps the fabric of Limbo in a 60-foot radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 force damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned. The area within the sphere becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.
