i now want to add the character section that i have in the group attack page on the swarm attack page. currently the swarm attack allows me to select how many attacks a character will take from the swarm but it doesn't track hp, it just tells me how many hit and the damage they do. i want something like i have in the group attack page where i can get an attack to say how much damage it will do, then have the ability to change the character targets ac or how much damage they will take from the attack (like + and -, and also half damage, quarter, no etc). I want this character section to be the source of truth both in the group attack page and the swarm attack page. for example, if they have a fight against enemies in the group attack page, whatever their hp etc is will be stored globally (I think it is already) so if i go to the swarm attack page it will be the same there, ideally using the same component. I also want a damage log, and some indication that damage has been applied, and remember i want the option to do half damage etc. Reuse whatever components you can.
