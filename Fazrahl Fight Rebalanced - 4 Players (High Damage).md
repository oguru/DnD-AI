# Fazrahl Fight Rebalanced - 4 Players (High Damage)

## Phase 1: The Fallen Herald Returns (Time Stop Opener)

**Fazrahl's Entrance:** The fallen herald descends with measured purpose, eyes like cold suns. He fights much as before—precise battlefield control into brutal melee—but now his stolen divinity sharpens every edge.

"So you have come for a second chance? Then let us replay our previous encounter, and let's see whether you are worthy to face my full power"

### Fazrahl (Empowered Herald) Stats:
- **AC:** 26  **HP:** 900  **Speed:** 60 ft., fly 60 ft.
- **STR:** 24  **DEX:** 20  **CON:** 24  **INT:** 22  **WIS:** 24  **CHA:** 26
- **Saving Throws:** Str +16, Dex +14, Con +16, Int +15, Wis +16, Cha +17
- **Damage Resistances:** psychic, fire, radiant, bludgeoning/piercing/slashing from nonmagical attacks
- **Damage Immunities:** necrotic
- **Condition Immunities:** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned
- **Senses:** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 24
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**

### Phase Intro – God-Voice of Dread
Before this phase begins, Fazrahl's voice manifests in three ways at once—booming from everywhere, as horrifying whispers, and inside each mind. All creatures in the chamber must make a **DC 26 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.

### Actions
- **Multiattack:** Fazrahl makes three attacks with his adaptive hand blades.
- **Adaptive Hand Blades:** Melee Weapon Attack: **+22 to hit**, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: **10d8 + 12** damage. On each attack, Fazrahl chooses the damage type: slashing, force, radiant, necrotic, cold, lightning, or thunder.
- **Crown of Stars (Bonus Action):** Ranged Spell Attack: **+22 to hit**, 120 ft., one target. Hit: 4d12 radiant damage. Seven motes orbit him until expended.
- **Spellcasting:** 20th-level caster (save **DC 25**, **+22 to hit**).
- At will: command, hellish rebuke. 
- 3/day each: fireball, hold person. 
- 2/day each: cone of cold (9d8, 60-ft cone), dispel magic. 
- 1/day each: Time Stop (5 rounds), Sunbeam, Symbol (Death), Contingency (Thunder Step; if a creature ends its turn within 10 ft., teleport and the creature takes 9d10 thunder, Con save for half).

### Time Stop Opener (example sequence)
- **Round 1:** Delayed Blast Fireball placed to catch multiple targets. Bonus: Misty Step to elevation. Positioning for advantage.
- **Round 2:** Prismatic Barrier (custom 60‑ft sphere variant of Prismatic Wall) encloses a zone or segments the field with layered resistances/effects.
- **Round 3:** Reposition and lay a Symbol or other control as needed.
- **Round 4:** Mirror Image. Bonus: Crown of Stars active (motes primed). Casts Meteor Swarm and stages a second Necrotic Meteor.
- **When time resumes:** The delayed blast detonates and the prismatic sphere warps the battlefield. Immediately after, two meteors crash down: **Meteor Swarm** (fire/bludgeoning as normal) and a second **Necrotic Meteor** (same areas; creatures make the same saves vs. necrotic instead of fire). Fazrahl then spends legendary actions to strike with his hand blades and a Crown of Stars mote, closing to finish in melee.

### Legendary Actions
- **Attack:** Make one hand blade attack.
- **Crown of Stars:** Make one mote attack.
- **Teleport:** Fazrahl teleports up to 60 ft.
- **Cast Spell (Costs 2):** Cast a spell that takes 1 action.
- **Soul Harvest (Costs 3):** If a creature has **99 HP or fewer**, it dies. Otherwise, it takes **10d10 necrotic** damage.

### Ending Condition
When Fazrahl is reduced to **450 HP** or at the end of **Round 5**, he unravels into shadowed tendrils that lance across the battlefield, plunging each hero into an isolated void.

**Fazrahl:** "Your souls contain the seeds of your own undoing. It is time for some self-reflection."

## Phase 2: The Void of Mirrors (Tendril Isolation)
### Phase Intro – God-Voice of Dread
Before this phase begins, Fazrahl's voice manifests in three ways at once—booming from everywhere, as horrifying whispers, and inside each mind. All creatures in the chamber must make a **DC 26 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.


**Break and Isolate:** Fazrahl's body dissolves into writhing tendrils that streak along the floor, walls, and air. Each tendril spears into a hero's shadow and pulls them into a personal void—silent, lightless, and inescapable.

### Mirror Mechanics
- Each player is isolated in their own 40-ft-radius void sphere where only they and a mirror-self exist.
- When a player defeats their mirror, they re-emerge and can step through the tendril-tears to enter another ally's void to help.

#### Shadow Stats Template (for full combat resolution)
- **AC/HP/Stats:** As the original character, but with 80% of their HP
- **Damage Type Conversion:** All damage they deal becomes necrotic
- **Radiant Vulnerability:** Vulnerable to radiant
- **Inversions:** Any healing ability becomes harm; immunity to being turned/banished

#### Simplified Void Challenge (fast resolution)
Instead of full mirrors, run a 3-round challenge with saves at **DC 26**:
1. Wisdom (resolve doubts): success halves incoming necrotic this phase
2. Charisma (assert identity): success negates disadvantage from doubt and grants advantage on the next save
3. Constitution (endure the void): success halves final damage

Outcomes (choose the tone you prefer):
- Success on all 3: defeat mirror instantly; immediately may enter an ally's void to grant them advantage on their next check.
- Success on 2: take 15d10 necrotic, defeat mirror.
- Success on 1: take 25d10 necrotic, defeat mirror.
- Failure on all 3: take 35d10 necrotic; remain trapped one additional round or until an ally enters to help (ally presence grants advantage).

### Ending Condition
When all mirrors are defeated (or 3 rounds pass in the simplified mode), the voids rupture simultaneously.

**Transition:** The rupturing voids coalesce around Fazrahl. He howls, detonates into a skittering mass—heralding the Swarm Lord.

## Phase 3: The Swarm Lord (Rounds 13-20)
**Fazrahl:** "Your bodies are so fragile, so limited. Let me show you what true power means."
### Phase Intro – God-Voice of Dread
Before this phase begins, Fazrahl's voice manifests in three ways at once—booming from everywhere, as horrifying whispers, and inside each mind. All creatures in the chamber must make a **DC 26 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.


**Fazrahl's Metamorphosis:** With a roar of agony and rage, Fazrahl's form explodes into a writhing mass of shadow and flesh. His body stretches and distorts into a grotesque, spider-like monstrosity the size of a house, with six glowing eyes floating around his main form like malevolent satellites. Each eye pulses with different colored energy, and his massive form skitters across walls and ceiling with unnatural grace.

### Fazrahl (Swarm Form) Stats:
- **AC:** 20 **HP:** 2000 (reduced from 2500) **Speed:** 50 ft., climb 50 ft., burrow 30 ft.
- **STR:** 30 **DEX:** 16 **CON:** 28 **INT:** 20 **WIS:** 22 **CHA:** 26
- **Saving Throws:** Con +19, Wis +16, Cha +18
- **Damage Resistances:** Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, Cold, Lightning
- **Damage Vulnerabilities:** Attacks that also heal the attacker or allies
- **Damage Immunities:** Poison, Disease, Necrotic
- **Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Prone, Stunned
- **Senses:** Blindsight 150 ft., Tremorsense 150 ft., Truesight 120 ft.
- **Challenge Rating:** 26

### **CRITICAL MECHANIC - Swarm Body:**
- **ALL attacks against the main body deal only 1 damage**
- **Only attacks against the floating eyes deal full damage**
- **Eyes are the only way to meaningfully damage this form**

### Floating Eyes (6 total):
- **AC:** 22 **HP:** 70 each (reduced from 80) **Speed:** fly 80 ft. (hover)
- **When eye is destroyed:** Swarm loses corresponding attack option
- **Eye Regeneration:** Every 5 rounds (increased from 4), 1 destroyed eye regenerates (70 HP)
- **Eye Defense:** Each eye has resistance to all damage types except radiant and force

**Actions (based on remaining eyes):**
- **Thunderous Clap (1 eye):** 80-foot cone. DC 25 Con save or 10d6 thunder damage + knocked prone + deafened 1 minute (half damage, not prone/deafened on success)
- **Crushing Stomp (1 eye):** 40-foot radius around feet. DC 25 Dex save or 12d8 bludgeoning damage + restrained until end of next turn + 1d4 levels of exhaustion
- **Pestilent Breath (1 eye):** 80-foot cone. DC 25 Con save or 8d8 poison damage + poisoned 1 hour + diseased + max HP reduced by damage dealt
- **Psychic Swarm (1 eye):** All creatures in chamber. DC 25 Wisdom save or 8d6 psychic damage + confused for 1 minute + stunned until end of next turn
- **Laser Eyes (2 eyes, Recharge 4-6):** Two 150-foot lines, 10 feet wide. DC 25 Dex save or 12d8 radiant damage + blinded 1 minute
- **Swarm Convergence (All Eyes, 1/Phase):** All eyes focus their energy on a single target within 120 feet. The target must make a DC 30 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 25d10 force damage and are stunned for 1d4 rounds. On a success, they take half damage and are not stunned.

**Legendary Actions (4 per turn):**
- Move up to speed
- One eye attack (if available)
- Swarm Split (costs 2 actions): Split into two smaller swarms for 1 round
- Laser Eyes (costs 3 actions, if available)

### Tactical Notes
- **Flying/climbing essential** to reach floating eyes
- **Focus fire** on individual eyes to reduce attack options
- **Positioning crucial** to avoid multiple area effects
- **Eye priority:** Laser Eyes > Psychic Swarm > Others

### Ending Condition
When all 6 eyes are destroyed, swarm form collapses

**Fazrahl**: "You cannot stop what I have already set in motion! My corruption will consume everything, even if I must drag you into the abyss with me!"

## Phase 4: The Chaos Lord (Final Phase)
**Fazrahl:** "Form is a comfort for the weak. I am unbound—will and ruin incarnate."
### Phase Intro – God-Voice of Dread
Before this phase begins, Fazrahl's voice manifests in three ways at once—booming from everywhere, as horrifying whispers, and inside each mind. All creatures in the chamber must make a **DC 26 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.


**Fazrahl's Final Form:** From the collapsing shadow realms, Fazrahl emerges as something beyond mortal comprehension. His form constantly shifts and changes—sometimes human, sometimes beast, sometimes pure energy. Reality bends around him like heated glass, and his very presence causes the laws of physics to writhe in protest. He appears as a living contradiction: beautiful and hideous, divine and profane, creation and destruction merged into one impossible being.

### Fazrahl (Chaos Form) Stats:
- **AC:** 32 **HP:** 2500 (reduced from 3125) **Speed:** 120 ft., fly 200 ft., teleport 200 ft., phase through matter
- **STR:** 30 **DEX:** 30 **CON:** 30 **INT:** 30 **WIS:** 30 **CHA:** 35
- **Saving Throws:** All +25 or higher
- **Damage Resistances:** Changes each round based on Reality Flux (minimum: all except force)
- **Damage Vulnerabilities:** Attacks that also heal the attacker or allies
- **Damage Immunities:** Psychic, Necrotic, Time, Reality; All conditions except incapacitated
- **Senses:** Omniscience, Omnipresence, Temporal Sight, Reality Sight
- **Challenge Rating:** 35

### **CRITICAL MECHANIC - Reality Flux:**
Each round, roll d8 for reality change (lasts until next flux):
1. **Gravity Reverses:** All creatures fly upward 60 ft unless anchored
2. **Time Distortion:** Initiative order reverses each turn
3. **Damage Conversion:** All damage types become random different types
4. **Spell Chaos:** All spells target random valid targets within range
5. **Size Flux:** All creatures randomly become Large or Small
6. **Energy Inversion:** Healing becomes damage, damage becomes healing
7. **Memory Shuffle:** Players must use each other's character sheets for 1 round
8. **Planar Overlap:** Ghosts of dead enemies appear and attack

**Actions:**
- **Multiattack:** Six different attacks each turn (can target same creature multiple times)
- **Paradox Blast:** 120-foot line. DC 35 Constitution save or take 15d6 damage of 8 random types + reality fracture (disadvantage on all rolls for 10 minutes) + lose 2 legendary resistances
- **Existential Crisis (Recharge 2-6):** 80-foot radius. DC 35 Wisdom save or stunned for 5 rounds, max HP reduced by 10d10, and question own existence (cannot use legendary actions)
- **Temporal Rift (At Will):** Undo any action taken in the last 3 rounds, or force a creature to repeat their last 3 actions, or skip target's next turn
- **Divine Contradiction:** Target takes 15d8 necrotic damage and heals 15d8 HP simultaneously (DC 35 Con save or be confused for 10 minutes + lose all remaining spell slots)
- **Chaos Storm (5/Day):** Chamber-wide effect. All creatures roll 2d20s - use lower roll for damage/higher for healing: 20d6 damage of random type OR heal 20d6 HP and gain major beneficial effect
- **Reality Shatter (3/Day):** All creatures within 150 feet make DC 35 Charisma save or be banished to random planes for 2d4 rounds + lose one divine power permanently on failure by 10+
- **Omnislash (1/Day):** Attacks every creature in chamber simultaneously with 25d10 + 30 damage of each: slashing, force, psychic, necrotic (DC 35 Dex save for half)
- **Cosmic Annihilation (1/Fight):** Fazrahl channels the full power of his stolen divinity. All creatures within 200 feet must make a DC 35 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 30d10 + 50 damage of a type that bypasses all resistances and immunities and are stunned for 1d4 rounds. On a success, they take half damage and are not stunned. After using this ability, Fazrahl cannot use legendary actions for 1 round.

**Legendary Actions (8 per turn):**
- Move or teleport
- One attack
- Reality Flux (change the current flux, costs 2 actions)
- Chaos Storm (costs 3 actions)
- Reality Shatter (costs 4 actions)
- Omnislash (costs 8 actions, 1/Day)

### The Turning Point
When Fazrahl is reduced to 750 HP (reduced from 950), party can attempt to stabilize reality with divine unity.

### **Ending the Fight - Divine Unity Ritual:**
Each party member must use their action to embrace a divine aspect (can attempt each round):
- **Justice (DC 30 Wisdom):** "I stand for what is right"
- **Knowledge (DC 30 Intelligence):** "I seek truth over comfort"  
- **Courage (DC 30 Charisma):** "I face fear without faltering"
- **Creation (DC 30 Constitution):** "I build rather than destroy"
- **Sacrifice (DC 30 Wisdom):** "I put others before myself"

**When all succeed in same round:** Combined divine radiance deals 1000 damage, ignoring all resistances and immunities. Reality stabilizes permanently. Fazrahl cannot use legendary actions or reactions for 2 rounds.

## New Mechanic: Damage to Healing Conversion

To compensate for the lack of a dedicated healer, add this special mechanic:

**Divine Sacrifice:** As a bonus action, any player can convert damage they deal to healing for themselves or allies. For every 10 points of damage dealt in a turn, they can convert 1d10 points into healing for any ally within 60 feet. This conversion happens after the damage is dealt to the enemy.

**Radiant Resonance:** Whenever a player deals radiant damage to Fazrahl, all allies within 30 feet of the player gain temporary hit points equal to 10% of the damage dealt.

**Hope's Embrace:** Once per short rest, as an action, a player can channel their divine energy to create a 20-foot radius healing aura centered on themselves. All allies in the aura regain hit points equal to 5d10 + the player's Charisma modifier.

---

## Backup NPC: Yrsa, Champion of Tyr

If the party is struggling severely (multiple members down with no resurrection available), Yrsa will appear as a divine intervention. She has the following simplified stat block for quick play:

### Yrsa (Divine Champion)
- **AC:** 28 **HP:** 550
- **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 20 ft.
- **Key Abilities:** 
  - **Divine Aura:** Allies within 10 ft gain 70 temp HP at the start of her turn
  - **Healing Focus:** All healing spells cast at 3x effectiveness
  - **Combat:** +12 to hit, 54 damage per hit (27 bludgeoning, 27 radiant)

**Key Actions:**
- **Mass Cure Wounds (1/Day):** Heal up to 6 creatures for 54 HP each
- **Sanctuary Aura (1/Day):** 20-ft radius sphere, allies gain resistance to all damage and advantage on saves for 1 minute
- **Tyr's Justice (1/Day):** 30-ft radius, 63 radiant damage and blind enemies (DC 22 Cha save for half damage, no blind)

**Tactics:** Yrsa will focus primarily on healing and support, using her Divine Aura to provide temporary HP while using her action to heal fallen party members. She'll only attack if all party members are stable.

---

## Adjusted Environmental Effects

To make the battlefield more dynamic and provide tactical options for 4 players:

1. **Healing Fonts:** 3-4 glowing pools appear around the battlefield that can be used to heal 6d10 HP once per character

2. **Divine Anchors:** Pillars that players can attune to (bonus action) to gain resistance to one damage type for 1 minute

3. **Reality Tears:** Areas where players can briefly step through (action) to avoid AoE effects or reposition

4. **Hope Crystals:** Destructible objects that, when shattered, create a 15-ft radius zone where all healing is doubled for 1 round

These environmental features give the smaller party more tactical options to compensate for fewer actions per round.

## Damage Comparison with Archfiend Despair Lords

### Archfiend Despair Lord Attacks:
- Soul Rend: 10d10 + 10 necrotic damage (4 attacks per round) = 4 × (55+10) = 260 damage per round
- Despair Nova: 12d8 poison damage (avg 54) + stunned for 2 rounds
- Sacrificial Pact: 50d8 + 20 psychic damage (avg 245) to all targets

### Fazrahl (Shadow Form) Attacks:
- Shadow Bolt: 12d10 + 20 necrotic + 6d6 psychic (avg 92) × 4 = 368 damage per round
- Shadow Storm: 18d8 necrotic damage (avg 81) + blinded
- Abyssal Sacrifice: 25d8 + 30 psychic damage (avg 142.5) to all targets + stunned

### Fazrahl (Final Form) Attacks:
- Omnislash: 25d10 + 30 damage of each: slashing, force, psychic, necrotic (avg 567.5 total) to all targets
- Cosmic Annihilation: 30d10 + 50 damage (avg 215) to all targets + stunned

This revised version ensures Fazrahl's damage output meets or exceeds the Archfiend Despair Lords, making him a truly terrifying final boss worthy of the campaign's climax.
