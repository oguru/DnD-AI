# Fazrahl Fight Rebalanced - 4 Players (High Damage)

## Phase 1: The Fallen Herald Returns (Time Stop Opener)

**Fazrahl's Entrance:** The fallen herald descends with measured purpose, eyes like cold suns. He fights much as before—precise battlefield control into brutal melee—but now his stolen divinity sharpens every edge.

"So you have come for a second chance? Then let us replay our previous encounter, and let's see whether you are worthy to face my full power"

### Fazrahl (Empowered Herald) Stats:
- **AC:** 26  **HP:** 1000  **Speed:** 60 ft., fly 60 ft.
- **STR:** 24  **DEX:** 20  **CON:** 24  **INT:** 22  **WIS:** 24  **CHA:** 26
- **Saving Throws:** Str +16, Dex +14, Con +16, Int +15, Wis +16, Cha +17
- **Damage Resistances:** psychic, fire, radiant, bludgeoning/piercing/slashing from nonmagical attacks
- **Damage Immunities:** necrotic
- **Condition Immunities:** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned
- **Senses:** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 24
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**

### Phase Intro – God-Voice of Dread
Before this phase begins, Fazrahl's voice manifests in three ways at once—booming from everywhere, as horrifying whispers, and inside each mind. All creatures in the chamber must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.

### Actions
- **Multiattack:** Fazrahl makes four attacks with his adaptive hand blades.
- **Adaptive Hand Blades:** Melee Weapon Attack: **+23 to hit**, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: **10d10 + 12** damage. On each attack, Fazrahl chooses the damage type: slashing, force, radiant, necrotic, cold, lightning, or thunder.
- **Crown of Stars (Bonus Action):** Ranged Spell Attack: **+23 to hit**, 120 ft., one target. Hit: 4d12 radiant damage. Seven motes orbit him until expended.
- **Spellcasting:** 20th-level caster (save **DC 25**, **+23 to hit**).
- At will: command, hellish rebuke. 
- 3/day each: fireball, hold person. 
- 2/day each: cone of cold (9d8, 60-ft cone), dispel magic. 
- 1/day each: Time Stop (5 rounds), Sunbeam, Symbol (Death), Contingency (Thunder Step; if a creature ends its turn within 10 ft., teleport and the creature takes 9d10 thunder, Con save for half).

### Time Stop Opener (example sequence)
- **Round 1:** Delayed Blast Fireball placed to catch multiple targets. Bonus: Misty Step to elevation. Positioning for advantage.
- **Round 2:** Prismatic Barrier (custom 60‑ft sphere variant of Prismatic Wall) encloses a zone or segments the field with layered resistances/effects.
- **Round 3:** Reposition and lay a Symbol or other control as needed.
- **Round 4:** Mirror Image. Bonus: Crown of Stars active (motes primed). Casts Meteor Swarm with a third Necrotic Meteor.
- **When time resumes:** The delayed blast detonates and the prismatic sphere warps the battlefield. Immediately after, two meteors crash down: **Meteor Swarm** (fire/bludgeoning as normal) and a second **Necrotic Meteor** (same areas; creatures make the same saves vs. necrotic instead of fire). Fazrahl then spends legendary actions to strike with his hand blades and a Crown of Stars mote, closing to finish in melee.

### Legendary Actions
- **Attack:** Make one hand blade attack.
- **Crown of Stars:** Make one mote attack.
- **Teleport:** Fazrahl teleports up to 60 ft.
- **Cast Spell (Costs 2):** Cast a spell that takes 1 action.
- **Soul Harvest (Costs 3):** If a creature has **99 HP or fewer**, it dies. Otherwise, it takes **10d10 necrotic** damage.

## Phase 2: The Void of Mirrors (Tendril Isolation)
**Fazrahl:** "Your souls contain the seeds of your own undoing. It is time for some self-reflection."

**Break and Isolate:** When Fazrahl is reduced to **450 HP** or at the end of **Round 5**, he unravels into shadowed tendrils that lance across the battlefield, plunging each hero into an isolated void. His body dissolves into writhing tendrils that streak along the floor, walls, and air. Each tendril spears into a hero's shadow and pulls them into a personal void—silent, lightless, and inescapable.

*All creatures must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.*

### Mirror Mechanics
- Each player is isolated in their own 40-ft-radius void sphere where only they and a mirror-self exist.
- **Players MUST defeat their mirror to escape their void** - there is no quick or easy way out.
- When a player defeats their mirror, they re-emerge and can see the other voids as translucent spheres.
- Players can then step through the tendril-tears to enter another ally's void to help them fight their mirror.
- **All mirrors must be defeated for this phase to end.**

#### Mirror Stats (based on player characters)
- **AC/HP/Stats:** As the original character, but with 80% of their HP
- **Damage Type Conversion:** All damage they deal becomes necrotic
- **Radiant Vulnerability:** Vulnerable to radiant
- **Inversions:** Any healing ability becomes harm; immunity to being turned/banished
- **Defenses:** Match the original character's resistances and immunities exactly

---

## Phase 3: The Swarm Lord (Rounds 13-20)

As the last mirror is destroyed, the spheres dissolve back into tendrils black tendrils which coalesce and move back to where Fazrahl last was, reforming and knitting his previous form back together.

**Fazrahl:** "Your bodies are so fragile, so limited. Let me show you how true power appears."

*All creatures must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.*

**Fazrahl's Metamorphosis:** With a ROAAAARR, Fazrahl's form explodes into a writhing swarm. His body stretches and distorts into a monstrosity the size of a house, with six glowing eyes floating within his main form like malevolent satellites. Each eye pulses with different colored energy.



### Fazrahl (Swarm Form) Stats:
- **AC:** 20 **Speed:** 50 ft., climb 50 ft., burrow 30 ft.
- **STR:** 30 **DEX:** 16 **CON:** 28 **INT:** 20 **WIS:** 22 **CHA:** 26
- **Saving Throws:** Con +19, Wis +16, Cha +18
- **Damage Resistances:** Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, Cold, Lightning
- **Damage Immunities:** Poison, Disease, Necrotic
- **Condition Immunities:** All
- **Senses:** Blindsight 150 ft., Tremorsense 150 ft., Truesight 120 ft.
- **Challenge Rating:** 26

### **CRITICAL MECHANIC - Swarm Body:**
- **The main body has NO HP and takes NO damage**
- **Only attacks against the floating eyes deal damage**
- **Eyes are the only way to meaningfully damage this form**
- **All 6 eyes must be destroyed to end this phase**

### Floating Eyes (6 total):
- **AC:** 22 **HP:** 350 each; Eye of Radiance has 500  **Speed:** fly 80 ft. (hover)
- **When eye is destroyed:** Swarm loses corresponding attack option



- **Eye Defense:** Each eye resistant to piercing, acid, fire, slashing, poison, lightning, force. Immunity to other damage types.

**Unique Eyes and Attacks (each eye uses only its own attack):**
- **Eye of Thunder — Thunderous Clap (1 eye):** 80-foot cone. DC 25 Con save or 10d10 thunder damage + knocked prone + deafened 1 minute (half damage, not prone/deafened on success).
- **Eye of Gravity — Gravitic Crush (1 eye):** 60-foot radius singularity at a point within 120 ft; area becomes difficult terrain until start of next turn. DC 25 Str save or take 10d10 force damage and be restrained until end of next turn; on success, half damage and not restrained. Creatures pulled 20 ft toward center before the save.
 - **Eye of Dominion — Ravage Divinity (1 eye):** Fazrahl intones, "I shall take your divinity." The targeted creature must make the same God‑Voice save: **DC 24 Wisdom**; on a failure, take **20d10 psychic** damage and are frightened until the end of their next turn (half and not frightened on success). Then, until Fazrahl’s **next attack** resolves, affected creatures **cannot use divine powers** (class features, divine boons, divine magic item effects, and reality/healing boons are suppressed). Fazrahl’s next attack is **empowered**, dealing **+10d10 force** damage and made with **advantage** (or **+2 to save DC** if it requires a save).
 - **Eye of Madness — Psychic Swarm (1 eye):** All creatures in chamber. DC 25 Wis save or **12d6 psychic** damage + confusion (as spell) for 1 minute; additionally stunned until end of next turn (on success, half damage and no conditions).
 - **Eye of Plague — Virulent Miasma (1 eye):** 120‑ft cone. DC 25 Con save or **6d8 necrotic** damage and become **diseased** for 1 hour. While diseased, a creature has **disadvantage on Con saving throws** and its **speed is reduced by 10 ft**. A diseased creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the disease on a success. On success, a creature takes half damage and is not diseased.
- **Eye of Radiance — Blinding Nova (charge‑up, 1 eye):** On charge turn, the eye glows intensely and emits a high keening; it cannot use Blinding Nova again until after it detonates. On the following turn, it detonates a 150‑ft radius burst centered on itself. DC 25 Dex save or 20d10 radiant damage + blinded 1 minute; creatures behind total cover are unaffected. On success, half damage and not blinded.

**Round Structure:**
- On its turn, Fazrahl uses **2 eye attacks and 1 swarm body action**. If only 1 eye remains, he will instead use **1 eye attack** and **2 body actions**
- Each eye can only use its own unique attack; an eye cannot attack more than once per round.

**Swarm Body Actions (1-2 per round):**
- **Giant Hand Clap:** 60-foot cone. DC 25 Con save or 20d8 bludgeoning damage + stunned until end of next turn. Half on save.
- **Swarm Projectiles:** 8d8 piercing damage to all creatures within 100 ft (no save)
- **Tendril Lash:** 30-foot reach, +20 to hit, 6d8 + 10 necrotic damage + grappled (escape DC 20)
 - **Pestilent Breath:** 80-foot cone. DC 25 Con save or **10d10 poison** damage and become **poisoned** for 3 rounds (on success, half damage and not poisoned)

**Legendary Actions (4 per turn):**
- Move up to speed
- One eye attack (costs 2 actions, can use as a reaction)
- One swarm body action (costs 2 actions)

### Tactical Notes
- **Flying/climbing essential** to reach floating eyes
- **Focus fire** on individual eyes to reduce attack options
- **Positioning crucial** to avoid multiple area effects
- **Use cover** against Blinding Burst charge-up
- **Eye priority:** Blinding Nova > Ravage Divinity > Psychic Swarm > Gravitic Crush > Thunderous Clap > Virulent Miasma

## Phase 4: The Chaos Lord (Final Phase)
**Fazrahl:** "Form is a comfort for the weak. I am unbound—will and ruin incarnate."

*All creatures must make a **DC 24 Wisdom** saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes **8d10 psychic** damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't frightened.*

**Fazrahl's Final Form:** ...and the swarm collapses into a writhing mass of unstable raw energy and matter that defies comprehension. At its core you get brief glimpses of a divine light that appears to be constrained. This thing before you appears as a living contradiction: 
beautiful and hideous, divine and profane, creation and destruction 
merged into one impossible being.

### Fazrahl (Chaos Form) Stats:
- **AC:** 28 **HP:** 2000 **Speed:** 60 ft., fly 120 ft., teleport 120 ft.
- **STR:** 28 **DEX:** 24 **CON:** 28 **INT:** 26 **WIS:** 26 **CHA:** 30
- **Saving Throws:** Str +18, Dex +16, Con +18, Int +16, Wis +16, Cha +20
- **Damage Resistances:** All damage types except force
- **Damage Immunities:** Psychic, Necrotic; All conditions except incapacitated
- **Senses:** Truesight 120 ft., Blindsight 60 ft.
- **Challenge Rating:** 30

### **CRITICAL MECHANIC - Reality Flux:**
Each round, roll d6 for reality change (lasts until next flux):
1. **Gravity Shift:** All creatures must make DC 20 Dex save or fall prone
2. **Damage Conversion:** All damage becomes a single type for the round (roll d8)
3. **Spell Reflection:** All spells cast have a 50% chance to target the caster instead
4. **Arc Flash:** The first time each creature moves more than 10 feet on its turn, it takes 4d8 lightning damage (DC 20 Con save for half)
5. **Energy Inversion:** Healing becomes damage, damage becomes healing
6. **Annihilation Wake:** The first time each creature hits with an attack on its turn, the target erupts; all other creatures within 30 feet of the target take 6d8 force damage (no save)

**Actions (3 per turn):**
- **Formless Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: **+20 to hit**, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: **10d8 + 12** force damage. Fazrahl can shift his form to attack from any direction (ignores cover).
- **Void Collapse:** 40‑ft radius centered on a point within 90 ft. DC 20 Str save or be pulled **30 ft** toward the center and take **8d8 force** damage. On success, pulled **15 ft** and half damage. The center becomes difficult terrain until the start of Fazrahl's next turn.
- **Fracture Reality (Recharge 4‑6):** 60‑ft cone. DC 20 Int save or take **10d10 psychic** damage and suffer **temporal displacement**: the creature's next turn is skipped, and when they next act, they are confused (as the spell) for 1 round. On success, half damage and no displacement.
- **Consuming Hollow (Recharge 5‑6):** Fazrahl creates a 20‑ft radius sphere of absolute void within 120 ft that lasts until the start of his next turn. Creatures starting their turn in the sphere or entering it for the first time take **6d10 necrotic** damage (no save) and their speed is halved until the end of their turn. Ranged attacks and spells cannot pass through the sphere.
- **Unmaking Touch (Recharge 5‑6):** One creature within 10 ft. DC 20 Cha save or take **12d8 force** damage and lose one of: (roll d4) 1) a magic item becomes non‑magical for 1 minute, 2) all spell slots of highest level available, 3) all class features requiring a resource until short rest, 4) max HP reduced by half the damage dealt. On success, half damage and no additional effect.
- **Essence Drain (2/Day):** All players must make a **DC 20 Con** save. On a fail, take **20d10 necrotic** damage and Fazrahl regains HP equal to the total damage dealt. On success, half damage and Fazrahl regains no HP.
- **Oblivion Surge (1/Fight):** Fazrahl releases pure destructive energy in a **150‑ft radius**. All creatures make **DC 22 Dex** save or take **30d10 +10 force** damage and are knocked prone and pushed **20 ft** away from Fazrahl. On success, half damage and no additional effects. After using this, Fazrahl cannot use legendary actions until the end of his next turn.

**Legendary Actions (3 per turn):**
- **Phase Shift:** Move or teleport up to 60 ft without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Lash of Entropy:** Make one Formless Strike attack.
- **Reality Warp (Costs 2):** Roll a new **Reality Flux** result or choose one from the list; it replaces the current Flux until the next round. Alternatively, release a **20‑ft‑radius pulse** within 60 ft: creatures make **DC 20 Con** save or take **4d8 force** and be pushed **10 ft** away (half damage and no push on success).

### **The Turning Point - Pelor's Call**
When Fazrahl is reduced to **1000 HP or below**, the divine light trapped at his core flares brightly, and a voice resonates through each hero's mind—warm, commanding, and unmistakably divine:

**"Children of light, I am bound but not broken. His corruption cannot hold me forever. Strike true, anchor reality, and together we shall shatter these chains of darkness. May the darkness be illuminated by my blinding light."**

The party realizes they must weaken Fazrahl's grip on the stolen divinity and free Pelor's essence to end this fight.

### **Ending the Fight - Liberation of Pelor:**

**Phase A: Earn Divine Resonance (6 total needed)**
The party must accumulate **6 Resonance points** through these actions:
- **+1** when a PC deals **radiant damage** to Fazrahl
- **+1** when a PC converts damage to healing using **Divine Sacrifice**
- **+1** when a PC succeeds on a **Reality Flux** save
- **+1** when the party ends a round with all members within **30 ft** of each other (circle formation)
- **+1** when a PC uses their **action** to make a DC 20 **Arcana/Religion/Insight** check to "Stabilize Reality"
- **+2** maximum per round

**Phase B: Form the Trinity Seal (when Resonance = 6)**
Once 6 Resonance is achieved, Pelor's light pulses and three golden anchor points appear on the battlefield, forming a **triangle** around Fazrahl (at least 40 ft apart). The party has **2 rounds** to complete the seal:

1. **Plant Anchors:** Three different PCs must each use an **action** to plant/attune an anchor (DC 20 Arcana/Religion/Athletics). On a failure, take **4d6 radiant** backlash and the anchor is not planted. An anchor can be re-attempted.

2. **Channel the Seal:** Once all 3 anchors are planted, one PC must stand at an anchor and use their **action to concentrate** (maintaining concentration as if on a spell). 
   - Each time the channeling PC takes damage: **DC 15 Con save** to maintain (allies within 30 ft can use **reaction** to grant **+2** to a failed save)
   - At the **end of the channeling PC's next turn** (if concentration held): The seal completes

**Phase C: Liberation (when seal completes)**
Pelor's essence erupts from Fazrahl's core in a blinding column of radiant light. Fazrahl screams as the divine spark tears free:
- Fazrahl takes **1500 true damage** (ignores all resistances/immunities)
- He is **stunned** and loses all legendary actions/reactions
- Reality stabilizes—all Reality Flux effects end permanently

**If this doesn't kill him:** He has 1 final turn at half speed before collapsing, giving the party one last chance to strike him down.

**If concentration breaks:** All anchors flicker out. The party takes **6d6 force** damage. Resonance drops to **3** and they must build it back to 6 to try again.

---

## New Mechanic: Damage to Healing Conversion

To compensate for the lack of a dedicated healer, add this special mechanic:

**Divine Sacrifice:** As a bonus action, any player can convert damage they deal to healing for themselves or allies. For every 10 points of damage dealt in a turn, they can convert 1d10 points into healing for any ally within 60 feet. This conversion happens after the damage is dealt to the enemy.

**Radiant Resonance:** Whenever a player deals radiant damage to Fazrahl, all allies within 30 feet of the player gain temporary hit points equal to 10% of the damage dealt.

**Hope's Embrace:** Once per short rest, as an action, a player can channel their divine energy to create a 20-foot radius healing aura centered on themselves. All allies in the aura regain hit points equal to 5d10 + the player's Charisma modifier.

---

## Backup NPC: Yrsa, Champion of Tyr

If the party is struggling severely (multiple members down with no resurrection available), Yrsa will appear as a divine intervention. She has the following simplified stat block for quick play:

### Yrsa (Divine Champion)
- **AC:** 28 **HP:** 550
- **Speed:** 40 ft., fly 20 ft.
- **Key Abilities:** 
  - **Divine Aura:** Allies within 10 ft gain 70 temp HP at the start of her turn
  - **Healing Focus:** All healing spells cast at 3x effectiveness
  - **Combat:** +12 to hit, 54 damage per hit (27 bludgeoning, 27 radiant)

**Key Actions:**
- **Mass Cure Wounds (1/Day):** Heal up to 6 creatures for 54 HP each
- **Sanctuary Aura (1/Day):** 20-ft radius sphere, allies gain resistance to all damage and advantage on saves for 1 minute
- **Tyr's Justice (1/Day):** 30-ft radius, 63 radiant damage and blind enemies (DC 22 Cha save for half damage, no blind)

**Tactics:** Yrsa will focus primarily on healing and support, using her Divine Aura to provide temporary HP while using her action to heal fallen party members. She'll only attack if all party members are stable.

---

## Adjusted Environmental Effects

To make the battlefield more dynamic and provide tactical options for 4 players:

1. **Healing Fonts:** 3-4 glowing pools appear around the battlefield that can be used to heal 6d10 HP once per character

2. **Divine Anchors:** Pillars that players can attune to (bonus action) to gain resistance to one damage type for 1 minute

3. **Reality Tears:** Areas where players can briefly step through (action) to avoid AoE effects or reposition

4. **Hope Crystals:** Destructible objects that, when shattered, create a 15-ft radius zone where all healing is doubled for 1 round

These environmental features give the smaller party more tactical options to compensate for fewer actions per round.

## Damage Comparison with Archfiend Despair Lords

### Archfiend Despair Lord Attacks:
- Soul Rend: 10d10 + 10 necrotic damage (4 attacks per round) = 4 × (55+10) = 260 damage per round
- Despair Nova: 12d8 poison damage (avg 54) + stunned for 2 rounds
- Sacrificial Pact: 50d8 + 20 psychic damage (avg 245) to all targets

### Fazrahl (Shadow Form) Attacks:
- Shadow Bolt: 12d10 + 20 necrotic + 6d6 psychic (avg 92) × 4 = 368 damage per round
- Shadow Storm: 18d8 necrotic damage (avg 81) + blinded
- Abyssal Sacrifice: 25d8 + 30 psychic damage (avg 142.5) to all targets + stunned

### Fazrahl (Final Form) Attacks:
- Omnislash: 25d10 + 30 damage of each: slashing, force, psychic, necrotic (avg 567.5 total) to all targets
- Cosmic Annihilation: 30d10 + 50 damage (avg 215) to all targets + stunned

This revised version ensures Fazrahl's damage output meets or exceeds the Archfiend Despair Lords, making him a truly terrifying final boss worthy of the campaign's climax.
