Number 17: Painted Into a Corner

The party take a long rest in a room with a mysterious painting. The landscape artwork gives off a strong neutral magic aura, but is mundane to the senses.

When the players sleep in the room with the painting, they find themselves trapped in the landscape the painting showed. Also in this environment are creatures, all of which possess small bottles of strange, clear, strong-smelling liquid.

The players are trapped inside a magical painting. The liquid in the bottles is turpentine. Splashing the liquid on any player or creature/NPC in the painted world causes them to take a high amount of acid damage. If a player is reduced to 0 HP by this acid damage, they are freed from the trap and awake normally in the room where they fell asleep.

3 - The Seesaw Guardian - A seesaw set up with a key hanging from a string above one end. The players need to apply twice the force to the non-key end compared to the key end. This key can then be inserted into the back of a mechanical golem that is trying everything within its power to stop the party from getting the key (ie. pushing players off the seesaw, applying it's weight to the wrong end).

2 - The Greatest Weapon - A room filled with various weapon racks and all sorts of different weapons surrounding a statue of a knight with an outstretched hand, and a plaque that says "Bring to me the greatest weapon, that kings covet, puts warriors to ruin, and ends all battles." Putting any weapon in the hand of the statue causes it to become an animated weapon that attacks. Among the weapons is a sword called "Peacemaker", with an olive branch engraved in the handle. Placing the peacemaker in the hand of the statue solves the puzzle.

3 - The Lockpick's Door

There is a door in a smuggler's den. The door has a few archaic symbols at the top (This is a red herring. It's Theives Cant describing whatever's inside the room, you can be as subtle or as blatant as you like if you have a rogue) and what looks like seven locks and whispering coming from the door. There is a thick iron turning handle in the centre of the door.

The first lock says "Open" in Common.

The second lock says "Close" in Elvish.

The third lock says "Open" in Dwarvish.

The fourth lock says "Close" in Infernal.

The fifth lock says "Open" in Giant.

The seventh lock says "Close" in Halfling.

The sixth lock says "Close" in Undercommon.

The objective of the puzzle is to unlock the locks which say "Open" (DC 10, or the trap goes off) and to leave the locks which say "Close" closed, and then turn the door handle, otherwise the Lightning Rune in the centre of the hallway (or another trap of your design) activates. The challenge comes from the character's language limitations. Sometimes they will have to do some guess-work.

As you leave the room, the door closes behind you and you hear clicking of the locks in the door turning
