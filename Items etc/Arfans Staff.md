**Staff Level-Up Effects**

When reaching the required number of declarations, the staff undergoes a dramatic transformation:

**Level 0 → 1 (Awakening)**
"[Name] the [Appropriate Adjective] claims this staff as righteous spoils of battle!" or something similar

Upon this proclamation:
- A wave of force energy erupts from the staff, causing cloaks to billow and hair to whip back dramatically
- The orb blazes to life with brilliant blue light, casting dramatic shadows
- Mechanical components unlock with a series of satisfying clicks, whirring into new configurations
- The bearer's voice becomes supernaturally amplified for the proclamation
- A pulse of force energy ripples outward in a 15-foot radius (strong enough to flutter papers and extinguish small flames)
- The staff resonates with a deep, harmonic hum that builds to a crescendo
- Small objects within 10 feet briefly float and settle back down
- The bearer briefly levitates an inch off the ground as the staff recognizes its new master

**Level 1 → 2 (Advanced)**
- The orb in the staff's head pulses with bright light
- Small arcs of force energy crackle along its length
- The wielder feels a slight tingling sensation
- The staff whispers all previous declarations in succession
- Nearby loose objects briefly float and settle

**Level 2 → 3 (Authoritative)**
- The mechanical components shift and realign themselves
- The orb's color deepens to a more intense blue
- Force energy visibly courses through the metal inlays
- The wielder briefly hovers an inch off the ground
- A wave of force gently pushes outward (10ft radius)

**Level 3 → 4 (Ascendant)**
- The staff's metal components take on a brighter sheen
- Arcane symbols appear and float around the orb
- The mechanical parts begin moving more fluidly
- The wielder's voice becomes momentarily amplified
- Small objects within 30ft orbit the staff briefly

**Level 4 → 5 (Almighty)**
- The staff completely disassembles and reassembles in midair
- The orb pulses with blinding light and force energy
- All mechanical components become more pronounced
- The wielder levitates for several seconds
- A thunderous boom accompanies the transformation
- Previous declarations echo in nearby minds
- Wave of force energy (30ft radius, no damage)

*Each transformation takes about 6 seconds (one round) to complete. The staff cannot be used during this time, but the wielder maintains control of it. The effects are dramatic but harmless.*
