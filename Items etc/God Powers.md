With these divine blessings, your characters will find normal encounters completely unthreatening, which is appropriate for their ascension to semi-divine status. This creates several interesting opportunities:

4. **Environmental Challenges**: Divine realms might have environments that challenge even gods.

2. **Jizz'rek's Fractured Staff**: A weapon that grows in power as the wielder advances in divine levels, eventually allowing manipulation of reality in small ways

3. **The Celestial Keystone**: A focus that enhances divine abilities and can temporarily seal divine portals or contain fragments of divine power
