## Handling Normal Encounters

With these divine blessings, your characters will find normal encounters completely unthreatening, which is appropriate for their ascension to semi-divine status. This creates several interesting opportunities:

1. **Untouchable Against Mortals**: When facing mortal or lesser creatures, you can simply narrate the party's overwhelming victory without rolling dice.

2. **Wave Encounters**: For normal combat that needs to happen for narrative reasons, consider throwing massive waves of enemies at them (20-30 creatures at once).

3. **Elevation of All Enemies**: Consider giving all enemies in the celestial realms divine traits of their own.

4. **Environmental Challenges**: Divine realms might have environments that challenge even gods.

## Divine Artifacts

To complement their growing divine powers, consider introducing artifacts tied to Jizz'rek's forgotten domain:

1. **The Forgotten Deity's Crown**: Enhances the wearer's Divine Aura and allows them to cast Commune once per long rest to speak directly with Jizz'rek
   
2. **Jizz'rek's Fractured Staff**: A weapon that grows in power as the wielder advances in divine levels, eventually allowing manipulation of reality in small ways

3. **The Celestial Keystone**: A focus that enhances divine abilities and can temporarily seal divine portals or contain fragments of divine power
