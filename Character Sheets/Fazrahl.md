## Mythic Actions

If Fazrahl is about to be defeated:

- **Divine Spark Detonation (1/Day):** When Fazrahl is reduced to 0 hit points, he can use his reaction to unleash necrotic power and souls from himself, causing a massive explosion of corrupted divine energy. Each creature within 100 feet must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 78 (12d12) necrotic damage and 78 (12d12) radiant damage and is stunned for 1 minute (save again end of each turn). After using this feature, Fazrahl stands with renewed purpose, regains 200 hit points, and appears to be preparing to finish off any survivors before departing with the divine spark.

## Fazrahl's Time Stop Strategies

During Time Stop, Fazrahl can take 1d4+1 turns to set up devastating combinations. Since he can't directly damage enemies during stopped time, he uses these moments to create perfect battlefield control. Here are his preferred tactics:

- **Bless (Corrupted Version):** Enhances his own attack rolls and saving throws

### Example Time Stop Sequence (3 rounds)

**Round 1:**
- Action: Cast Delayed Blast Fireball (positioned to hit multiple party members)
- Bonus Action: Misty Step to high ground or strategic position
- Movement: Position for maximum effect

**Round 2:**
- Action: Cast Wall of Fire in a ring around the group (or in front)

**Round 3:**
- Action: Cast Force Cage behind the group
- Bonus Action: Channel Divine Energy (enhance Kavan'Turok with necrotic energy)

**Round 4:**
- Action: - Mirror Image - 3 duplicates of himself
- Bonus Action: Ring of Stars

**When time resumes:**
- Delayed Blast Fireball explodes 16d8
- Wall of Fire activates
- Anyone crossing the Symbol triggers its effect
- Fazrahl immediately uses legendary action to attack with Kavan'Turok
- Uses Crown of Stars as bonus action
