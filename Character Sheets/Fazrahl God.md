## Divine Traits

**Divine Aura:** Fazrahl radiates an aura of divinity in a 120-foot radius. When a creature enters this aura for the first time or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Additionally, creatures hostile to Fazrahl have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws while in the aura.

**Divine Awareness:** Fazrahl knows if his name is spoken anywhere in the multiverse. He can sense any creature with more than 50 hit points within 10 miles of any temple or shrine dedicated to him.

**Divine Resilience:** If Fazrahl fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead. He can use this ability five times per day.

**Divine Spellcasting:** Fazrahl's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 27, +19 to hit with spell attacks). He can cast any spell from the cleric, sorcerer, or warlock spell lists at will, requiring no material components. Additionally, the following spells are always active on Fazrahl:
- *Mind blank*
- *Foresight*
- *Death ward*

**Stolen Radiance:** As the usurper of Pelor's divinity, Fazrahl can manipulate light and solar energy at will. As an action, he can create or extinguish light in a 1-mile radius. Any spell or effect that produces light within this radius has its level or CR reduced by half if Fazrahl wishes.

**Immortality:** If Fazrahl would be reduced to 0 hit points outside his divine domain, his form dissipates instead, and he reforms at full health in his sanctum after 1d4 days. To truly destroy Fazrahl, he must be reduced to 0 hit points in his own divine domain or by a being of equal or higher divine rank.

## Actions

**Multiattack:** Fazrahl makes four attacks with Godsbane.

**Godsbane (Divine Weapon):** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 8) slashing damage plus 36 (8d8) necrotic damage. The target's maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. If this effect reduces a creature's hit point maximum to 0, the creature dies, and its soul is drawn into Godsbane, unable to be resurrected by any means short of a wish spell or divine intervention.

**Divine Nova (Recharge 5-6):** Fazrahl releases an explosion of corrupted divine energy in a 100-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, taking 78 (12d12) radiant damage and 78 (12d12) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save by 10 or more are also blinded for 1 minute.

**Dawn's End (3/Day):** Fazrahl creates an area of darkness 300 feet in radius that suppresses all light created by spells of 8th level or lower. Creatures of Fazrahl's choice within the area must make a DC 27 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. This darkness lasts for 1 minute or until dispelled by a 9th-level spell.

**Avatar of Corruption (1/Day):** Fazrahl transforms, growing to Huge size. For 1 minute, he gains 200 temporary hit points, his attacks deal an additional 22 (4d10) necrotic damage, and he can make one additional action on each of his turns. While transformed, his divine aura extends to 300 feet and creatures that fail their saving throw against it are paralyzed rather than frightened.

**Divine Word (1/Day):** Fazrahl utters a word of divine power that affects all creatures of his choice within 60 feet. Each target that can hear him must make a DC 27 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target suffers an effect based on its current hit points:
- 50 hit points or fewer: killed instantly
- 100 hit points or fewer: stunned for 10 minutes
- 150 hit points or fewer: blinded and deafened for 1 hour
- 200 hit points or fewer: deafened and frightened for 10 minutes

**Alter Reality (3/Day):** Similar to the wish spell, Fazrahl can alter reality in limited ways. He can duplicate any spell of 9th level or lower, create temporary objects or terrain features, heal all of his hit points, remove all conditions affecting him, or create similar effects appropriate to his divine domain. This power cannot directly harm creatures with divine rank or artifacts.

## Reactions

**Divine Shield:** When Fazrahl would be hit by an attack or affected by a spell, he can manifest a shield of divine energy. He gains a +10 bonus to his AC against one attack or automatically succeeds on a saving throw against one spell or effect. If the effect would deal damage and allows a saving throw for half damage, he takes no damage on a successful save.

**Retributive Smite:** When a creature within 30 feet of Fazrahl hits him with an attack, Fazrahl can force that creature to make a DC 27 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 28 (8d6) radiant damage and is pushed 20 feet away from Fazrahl.

## Legendary Actions

Fazrahl can take 5 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Fazrahl regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Attack:** Fazrahl makes one attack with Godsbane.

**Channel Divinity (Costs 2 Actions):** Fazrahl channels his stolen divinity to produce one of the following effects:
- **Corrupt Light:** All light sources within 60 feet are extinguished, and a sphere of magical darkness spreads from Fazrahl to fill a 60-foot radius.
- **Divine Fire:** Beams of corrupted solar fire strike up to three creatures Fazrahl can see within 120 feet. Each target must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) fire damage and 27 (5d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
- **Dark Blessing:** Fazrahl or one creature he can see within 30 feet regains 50 hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

**Cast Spell (Costs 3 Actions):** Fazrahl casts a spell of 7th level or lower.

**Divine Wrath (Costs 3 Actions):** Fazrahl targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 27 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 82 (15d10) necrotic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and isn't stunned.

**Reality Shift (Costs 4 Actions):** Fazrahl warps reality in a 30-foot radius area centered on a point he can see within 120 feet. The affected area becomes difficult terrain, the direction of gravity reverses, creatures are transported to a pocket dimension, or another effect similar to a 7th-level or lower spell occurs. This effect lasts until the end of Fazrahl's next turn.

## Mythic Actions

If Fazrahl is about to be defeated, he unveils his true power as a god and gains access to the following mythic actions:

**Mythic Trait: Pelor's Essence:** When Fazrahl drops to 0 hit points for the first time, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, the stolen essence of Pelor erupts from within him, restoring him to 750 hit points. While in this state, Fazrahl's eyes glow with blinding light, and all of his attacks and abilities deal an extra 11 (2d10) radiant damage.

**Mythic Action: Corrupted Sunburst (Costs a Mythic Action):** Fazrahl creates a sphere of corrupted solar energy with a 60-foot radius centered on a point within 150 feet. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) radiant damage and 55 (10d10) necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

**Mythic Action: Time Manipulation (Costs a Mythic Action):** Fazrahl briefly stops time for everyone but himself. He takes 1d4+1 turns in a row, during which other creatures can't take actions or reactions. This ability doesn't affect creatures with divine rank or those protected by artifacts that shield against time manipulation.

**Mythic Action: Consume Divinity (Costs a Mythic Action):** Fazrahl targets one creature within 30 feet that has divine abilities or powers granted by a deity. The target must make a DC 27 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, one of the target's divine abilities (DM's choice) is suppressed for 1 minute, and Fazrahl regains 50 hit points.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), Fazrahl can take a lair action while in his divine sanctum. He can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row.

- **Corrupted Mirrors:** Reflective surfaces within the lair become portals. Fazrahl can move from one reflective surface to another as if by the teleport spell. Additionally, 1d4 shadow duplicates of one creature Fazrahl can see emerge from reflective surfaces within 60 feet of that creature. These duplicates have the same statistics as the original but have half the hit points and deal half damage. They act immediately after Fazrahl in the initiative order and disappear after 1 minute.

- **Reality Warp:** Fazrahl causes an area of his lair to become unstable. The affected area (a 50-foot cube) experiences one of the following effects (roll 1d6):
  1. Gravity reverses
  2. Time flows at half speed (affected creatures have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, -2 AC, and can take only an action or a bonus action on their turn)
  3. Space distorts (distances are doubled for movement and ranged attacks)
  4. Elemental energy surges (creatures take 22 (4d10) damage of a random type at the start of their turns)
  5. Matter phases in and out (creatures have a 50% chance of being affected by attacks or spells)
  6. Mental energy bleeds into reality (creatures must make a DC 23 Wisdom save at the start of their turns or be confused as per the confusion spell until the end of their next turn)

- **Call Corrupted Servants:** Fazrahl summons 1d4 corrupted celestials (CR 10 or lower) or 2d4 shadow demons to unoccupied spaces within the lair. These creatures act immediately after Fazrahl in the initiative order and remain until slain or until Fazrahl dismisses them as an action.

## Regional Effects

The region containing Fazrahl's divine domain is warped by his power, creating one or more of the following effects:

- The sky within 10 miles of Fazrahl's sanctum is always darkened, as if in perpetual twilight, with occasional flashes of corrupted solar energy that deal 11 (2d10) radiant damage to any good-aligned creature caught in the open.

- Water within 1 mile of Fazrahl's sanctum occasionally transforms into a luminous, golden liquid that burns like acid, dealing 11 (2d10) radiant damage to any creature that touches it.

- Plants within 5 miles wither or transform into corrupted versions that radiate necrotic energy.

- When a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher sleeps within 1 mile of Fazrahl's sanctum, Fazrahl can invade its dreams, forcing it to make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature experiences tormenting nightmares and gains no benefit from the rest.

If Fazrahl is slain, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

## Battle Strategies

### Phase 1: Testing Defenses
Fazrahl begins by assessing his opponents' divine abilities. He uses his reactions defensively and focuses on controlling the battlefield with his Channel Divinity and Reality Shift legendary actions.

### Phase 2: Divine Oppression
After identifying the greatest threats, Fazrahl uses Dawn's End and Divine Nova to devastate the party while targeting spellcasters with Corrupt Light to restrict their visibility.

### Phase 3: Godslayer
When reduced to below half health, Fazrahl becomes more aggressive, using Godsbane to target the physically weakest party members first. He uses Avatar of Corruption and focuses on reducing maximum hit points.

### Phase 4: Mythic Resurrection
After his first "death," Fazrahl unleashes his mythic actions, starting with Time Manipulation to set up devastating combinations. He then uses Corrupted Sunburst to damage clustered opponents and Consume Divinity to neutralize the most powerful divine abilities being used against him.

### Phase 5: Divine Escape
If truly threatened, Fazrahl attempts to flee to recover, using Reality Shift to create obstacles while teleporting away. He will only fight to the death if cornered in his divine sanctum where his full power is realized.
