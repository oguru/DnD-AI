We awake in a prison cell without any of our equipment, wearing only tattered rags. With us is a tortle and a goblin we don’t recognise. It’s night and we’re all chained together along one side of a wall. Next to the cell is a wizard from the arcanist’s elite, one of dart’s cronies who captured us. A passing guard captain from the Dragon’s Claw makes conversation with the wizard and we learn that he’s really bored guarding us and having to sustain an anti-magic field all night while the prison’s anti-magic systems are down.
We exchange introductions with our cellmates. The Tortle is Lance, cast out and imprisoned by his rich father, a paladin of Pelor, for winning horse races on luck alone without a shred of talent, now trying to win back some favour. The goblin is a pirate captain named Kadakadamatazan (??) who apparently was thrown in here for “honest piracy.”
After getting our bearings, we try and get the attention of the wizard guarding us, but he remains largely unperturbed even by an onslaught of insults and Pyre flinging his poop at him. We eventually grow tired and fall asleep for the night. The next morning, the wizard is gone but we can still feel the antimagic field. Two dodgy looking fellows come up to our cell and take Pyre away with a bag over his head and arms shackled behind his back.
In the other cell, the two guys introduce themselves as Gunt and Arnoz, two contractors for Dart, and they seem to have some of our stuff, most noticeably the hitting-healing club we bought from Jizrek, with which they begin to torture Pyre for information on our friends and contacts. He tries blaming Moryx, which doesn’t help. When he’s knocked out, they drag him back to the cells and swap him out for Okurak. They get nothing from him, and Kada is next, then Lance. Pamykos annoys them for a while but is eventually forced to give up someone. He chooses ex-governor Lorrus, who seems the safest bet since he’s fled town. Gideon also gets taken at some point.
Back in our cells later on, a guard brings us food and Lance finds a note hidden in his food. It’s from Garrett, telling us he’s hiding spell components in our food. Okurak finds a small pendant with a lightning bolt on it, recognising that it may be a holy symbol for his god. Kada finds some tattered pieces of fleece-like fabric. Pyre finds glass spheres. Night falls and the same arcanist comes, but he remains able to resist insults, along with Okurak’s shit this time.
The next morning, Pyre scoops up a dead cricket and a caterpillar cocoon from the cell floor. We are once again taken for interrogation. They don’t get much from us since we mostly just waste their time, though they were intrigued when Pamykos told them about the giant lady with the four breasts. Regardless they seem to be more frightened of Fazrahl than willing to know more.
Back in our cells, Pamykos finds another note in his food, and Lance finds some nutshells (component for Confusion) and some gooey bead that tastes of eggshells (sulphur for delayed blast fireball?). The note also says Garrett can help in two days when his shift comes. As we hurl insults at the wizard guard, Okurak is able to break his shackles by turning into a bear and swipe some needle-like pine leaves from the barred window into the cell before transforming back. The wizard summons some people to bind him in chains.
Another morning, another round of interrogations. We waste their time some more. Then we get another note from Garrett saying he’s found our equipment and will create a distraction tomorrow night. We think, as Okurak struggled to read this one.
Pamykos finds a small amount of makeup in his food (component for friends). Pyre finds a small shard of sunstone. He also inspects a pine needle he picked up, but he can’t discern much beyond it smelling like bear shit and something else (Okurak really should have washed his hands) and not being strong enough to pick a lock. Lance finds a tiny ball that smells like some kind of poo. Kada finds a chip of something that smells like rotten egg. Pamykos scoops some sand from the cell floor (component for catnap). Gideon was taken away again separately from the questioning, but this time he didn’t return.
The night continues to pass, as the wizard continues to receive insults. In our dreams of a scary figure (Fazrahl?) doing powerful and evil things such as interrogating a bunch of scholars and turning them into husks. Pyre, Pamykos, and Kada wake up screaming and pissing while the others are ok.
The interrogations start again but they mix up the order, Kadakadamatazan (?) going first. They offer him a deal to get some info from the rest of us in exchange for freedom. He tries to lie about agreeing to it but they don’t buy it. Pamykos is willing to share that they dodged the cult’s ambush by teleporting back from the underdark to somewhere in town, and Pyre elaborates under duress that it was a beach, but not more. Lance refuses the deal to sell us out. Okurak adds that it was the south beach, not understanding why it matters that they know.
A little more food is brought by later, and we recognise it’s Garrett! Pamykos finds a note in his food telling us to break out after the distraction and to go straight, left, and straight again. Garrett will keep his cover and meet us in that room. Lance found a forked twig, Okurak found a sprig of mistletoe and Pyre found a pouch that smells like vomit. Kada finds a lockpick!
At night, one candle after the wizard guard arrives, the sounds of combat and a plea for help for a hobbling square-jawed guard calls the wizard away, freeing us from the anti-magic field. Pyre uses the lockpick to unlock his chains, Okurak’s, and Lances. Lance then frees Kada and Kada frees Pamykos. Okurak grabs the guard through the door and puts his shitty hand over the guard’s mouth. Kada yoinks the keys so we can unlock the door. Pyre tries to put the guard to sleep and fails but Okurak is able to banish the guard. We bolt down the corridor and turn left into the next room.
The wizard guard, whose name is Varian, commands us to halt and begins to cast but Pamykos casts confusion on him. The confusion works but only for a few moments, and Varian does manage to activate a powerful magic sphere of some kind centred on himself. Kada charges into the field, not feeling any obvious change, and gets behind the wizard. Okurak hits Varian with a sacred flame but his spiritual weapon doesn’t work, and as Okurak closes the distance his banishment fades and the guard from before returns. Lance casts aid on all of us except Kada (who’s too far away). Pamykos attacks with eldritch blast and Pyre tries to close range and use poison spray but it fails to cast. Varian retaliates with fireball.
The other guard attacks Pamykos and Lance but cuts himself once. Kada starts biting Varian’s shins. Okurak turns into a bear and charges. Pamykos starts headbutting the guard next to him, but Varian stops time for a moment and hits us all with chain lightning.
29/10/2024
Combat continues. Kada notices a clattering behind him as some weapons are dropped into the hall! He grabs a scimitar and re-engages with a flurry of slashes at Varian. Okurak mauls the wizard also! Lance slashes the guard with his claws, and Pamykos headbutts the guard too. Pyre tries to hit Varian over the head with a table but fails. Varian retaliates with a bigby’s hand, but drops concentration on his anti-magic field! Lance heals Pamykos, who unleashes a psychic lance on the attacking guard. Pyre pelts Varian with a snowball swarm and picks up a sword and shield. Kada slashes Varian one last time and brings him down, and attacks the guard also. Okurak terrifies the guard with a roar and Lance smites him with claws aflame. Pamykos torments the guard’s mind with another psychic lance. The guard tries to run, taking another slash from Lance’s claws. Kada chases the guard down and leaps at him with the scimitar, burying it in the guard’s back for the killing blow.
Pyre hands the longsword and shield off to Pamykos. Kada swipes a 100g pouch from the guard. Varian had a spell scroll of wish and a pouch of 200g. The gold is shared amidst the group. Garrett’s distraction is still underway, and we see him arrive and unlock a gate, ferrying us into a room with our equipment. He tells us the other guards had been forbidden to go through our stuff, but he had a chance to search it, and to study the orb during the shift changes! He says it’s been resisting the anti-magic aura of this prison and is trying to break free of its shell. He tells us to knock him out, grab our stuff, and use it since it’s probably our only way out. We quickly pick up all of our stuff. We have no time to don our armour, it’s time to go. It seems that breaking the shell of the orb, which has become much more active, will unleash its teleportation magic. With no time to spare, Lance shatters it, and away we go.
After a harrowing travel experience, we find ourselves in the plane of Limbo, a realm of pure chaos. We can feel ourselves being pulled apart and merged into one being, so we need to try and unify our minds to become stable again. We become an ocean of shared experiences and consciousness, seeing each other’s deepest darkest memories, shames, and secrets. Pyre acts the way he does out of fear for the world and a deep sense of abandonment, Pamykos is filled with regret and trauma from being possessed by Moryx and feels he will never be done trying to make up for the awful things he was forced to do. Lance feels the immense weight and the shame of being exiled by his father, and Kada’s past abuse at the hands of an orc captain, which led him to become a feared and deadly pirate captain flow through our minds. Okurak…
Our merged form stabilises, allowing us to perceive and stabilise the area around us better. We see a Githzerai monk floating on a cube of energy. He floats over to us and greets us, amused to see a merged consciousness so helpless in limbo. His name is Zith’Rax, and he begins to guide us in the process of shaping the chaos of this plane to our advantage. We focus our minds and form chaos into a doorway. He asks us what our plan is with the door, and we visualise the word Amal’Atsar (the name of the second artefact). He says he can help us retrieve it, but we will need help to function here, and we will need to help him with something in return.
The monastery-city of he and his fellows has been under siege by a great force, constructs made from hardened essence of limbo as the balance in the plane has broken down, and if we help him he’ll get us to the legendary amulet. He also speculates that the amulet may be in part responsible. We ask how we could help in our current state, but he says that we have great potential here, and he can help stoke that into a powerful fire, an entity with the power of 5 souls as one.
We follow him through limbo, aided by his aura of stability. As his city comes into view, we bear witness to a marvel of mental discipline, though cracks are beginning to show as the willpower begins to strain. He leads us past meditation chambers and across bridges of thought into a training courtyard where we will undergo some trials, beginning with the unity trial. Together, we form a metallic cube from the unstable energies. Next, we try for an icosahedron (a d20), which we manage, though it’s a bit hazy, and the numbers on the dice melt into words and twist on the surface. We try for a clockwork frog that will leap away, but we end up with a plodding, melty thing that bursts.
Next we try for a seedling growing into a small tree, and with some help from Zith’Rax, we manage it! Zith’Rax congratulates us and moves us on to a deeper test - a combat training exercise in which we will fight as one. We begin with a target dummy, each thinking of an aspect to embody. After a couple of tries, some weird constructs attack through cracks in the courtyard walls, seeking out sources of order to attack, and we spring into action.
We manifest weapons such as Pamykos’ rapier or Kada’s longswords, and spells such as Pyre’s minute meteors. A wild magic surge from Pyre’s spells made us and some of the enemies invisible, but the constructs nonetheless attack us with tears in reality that we manage to resist. We continue to attack, eventually shattering one into a million pieces. This also causes the others to begin to fracture, so perhaps they’re linked. After a few more attacks we bring the last of the first wave of constructs down.

19/11/2024
Defeating the first wave of constructs causes the larger construct outside the walls to begin to fracture into pieces and launch crystalline shards at the crystal spire keeping the monastery stable. The monks rush to maintain the crystal and Zith’Rax asks us to help defend the spire.
We attempt to conjure a barrier, but it was too weak to block the next shard, which drops pieces of it down to the ground and causes some nearby buildings to phase out out. Next, we redirect some of the energy from the next wave to repair the spire. Judging from the rate at which the colossus is destroying itself to attack the spire, it has another 6 waves. Then we counter-strike, turning some of the shards back on the colossus. We fail to counter the next strike or redirect the one after. We land another counter strike but fail to redirect another wave’s energy. We manage to redirect almost all of another wave, restoring some of the spire’s integrity. On our next counterattack, we fail completely, but then redirect another attack’s energy to repair the spire.
After one more conjured barrier and a counterattack, the colossus can no longer attack the spire, but has shed enough of its mass to pass through the city walls. The monks are busy maintaining the damaged spire and defending the rest of the town, so it falls to us to finish the colossus. Channelling our minds together to conjure different aspects, we begin with a flaming dash, trapping the colossus in a trail of fire as we lay into it with various attacks manifested from each of our selves. Eldritch blasts from Pamykos, burning hands from Pyre, longsword strikes from Khada, thunder waves from Okurak, and searing smites from Pyre.
The colossus retaliates by unleashing a field of distorted space to trap us and then trying to crush us with its arms, missing once and hitting the next. Our next aspect unleashes a veil of twilight, disorienting the colossus, but also triggers a wild magic surge, causing us to burst apart in an explosion, though we just about manage to reform. We evade two more swipes from the monster, but are hit by another wave of chaotic energy.
We shift aspects into a rage and unleash more attacks! Pamykos fires a burst of eldritch blasts for major damage, but the creature retaliates with a wave of shards. Lance launches a guiding bolt, Okurak heals the party, Khada lands a flurry of sword slashes, and Pyre unleashes a sunburst. The creature continues to shrink as it loses more and more mass, though it also continues to attack with another space distortion. We shift the aspect of our rage to be more directional, charging forward with a heavy blow. This releases more sharp shards, injuring us enough that Okurak’s presence almost shifts into bear-form, but he resists (+5 bear XP). Pamykos strikes with more eldritch blasts and the creature retaliates with a wave of energy. Lance cures some of our wounds, and Okurak offers us all a word of healing. One last attack from Khada shatters it into pieces, causing all of the other chaos seekers to collapse and the monks to erupt in celebration!
Do XP next time!
19/12/2024
The monks all express their deep gratitude for protecting their home. Zith’Rax tells us that we should rest, and that the monastery’s resources are at our disposal. However, he tells us that before we leave, the master of the monastery, Elder Kir’thax(?) has requested our presence. He rarely meets with outsiders, so this is an honour.
First, we check out the city’s marketplace. We first stop at a stall selling various magical armours, trinkets, and machines. Pyre arranges a discount, and expresses interest in an unusual cube with shifting symbols, which the merchant reveals is a Cube of Possibility, which allows the user to see two possible outcomes each day. Pyre purchases it for 350g (down from 500, or the 400 the merchant tried to offer it for!). There is also a chaos-touched compass that “points to what we desire mostly.”
It’s normally worth 1750g, and even with the discount as low as 900g, Pyre can’t afford it, but before we can discuss whether anyone else wants to lend Pyre the money or buy it for themselves, Jizrek suddenly shows up somehow and offers some of his classic wares, including some boots, an endless lunchbox, and a mystery bag.  Khada is interested in the bag, but uses the cube to observe the outcomes of reaching in there. He sees himself drawing either some playing cards or what looks like a health potion. He ends up buying the bag for 220g after we identify its functionality as a maybe-bag.
With a little more haggling (and borrowing 300g off of Pamykos), Pyre buys the compass for 800g. Khada also buys the boots for 53g, compared to Jizrek’s offering price of 100g, but when we identify them we learn that they randomise the direction you run in, but at double speed! You also can’t remove them for 24h after donning them. He keeps them for potential future use.
Pyre buys the lunchbox after getting a sample from it involving some singing shellfish, but we’re also not interested in an umbrella he offered that could sometimes block damage, but Pamykos buys a whistle with some wild magic properties for 65g. Lastly, Jizrek has a potion flask on offer for 100g. Attempts to haggle don’t seem to work this time, and we’re not certain, yet Pyre has us go for it when Jizrek offers for us to sample it. We end up feeling like if anyone were to try and follow us they’d find it difficult to do unseen as our awareness improves. Jizrek says it has a new effect every day, and Khada buys it.
Khada also contemplates buying some new swords from the previous merchant, but decides to wait until we’re on our way out of town. After cleaning the new whistle with prestidigitation, Pamykos gives it a blow, and we feel resistant to damage for a short while. Pyre boils some water and throws his shellfish from the box in it - they start screaming and don’t stop until the water cools, so Pyre leaves them behind, only coming back to reheat the water and start the screaming again, much to the annoyance of the townsfolk who are trying to get back to some peace and quiet.
We visit another shop and get a massage as a collective, which is weird. Pyre covers the 3g cost, which is odd because you’d think he wouldn’t have any money left. We do at least feel very relaxed and present in our collective body.
We then go to meet Kir’thax before we rest. We head to the central spire. As we enter the main part and are escorted to the meeting chamber. The Elder floats down to us. He says that nine generations of his forebears had awaited the coming of those who would seek the binder. He explains that three divine fragments were spread across the planes by the gods after they tore open the veil of the realms, one cast into chaos (limbo), one into darkness (the underdark), and one into the infernal flames (avernus or one of the other hells?). But a fourth splinter split away, possibly unknown to the gods. This was a spark of divine potential, which the Elder suggests had somehow found its way to Okurak amongst all of us (as the green gem he carries with him).
Paste from Protolyst:
"Ah... the merged ones," he says, his voice carrying the weight of ages. "I have been waiting. Nine generations of my line have kept watch for those who would seek the Binder.
"Would you hear the tale of what you seek? It was during the Time of Shifting Stars, when reality ran like water through our fingers. The gods themselves tore open the veil of our realms, and through that tear came three divine fragments: one cast into chaos where it would be balanced by the everlasting maelstrom, one thrust into the lightless depths where ancient kingdoms dwell in shadow, and one cast down into the infernal depths where even devils dare not tread. When the gods sundered their creation, such was the violence of their act that a single spark was cast off - an unintended fragment, a splinter of pure divine potential. Neither weapon nor tool, but something... between. The gods themselves may not know of its existence, for it was born of destruction rather than purpose. Like a key forged by the lock's own breaking, it holds the memory of what was once whole." He looks at you, peering deep into your collective souls with recognition - "Perhaps that is why it found its way to you, five-who-are-one, who understand both unity and division."
You have proven yourselves worthy defenders of Shra'kt'lor. The threads of destiny weave strangely here in Limbo, and I see much that was, is, and may yet be.The threads of fate have woven you five-who-are-one to my chamber, and the pattern speaks of questions that burn within. Three truths from the great beyond may I offer, three glimpses through chaos' veil. Choose wisely, for like water through cupped hands, once a truth flows, it cannot be gathered again. The pattern reveals.
The Elder continues, explaining that he gets glimpses through the chaos and can give us three answers to some questions in addition to telling us where the amulet (the divine fragment here in limbo) is, since that is already known to his tribe.
We ask him how we can get to the final piece that lies in the hells:
When asked about the final piece - "Ah, you seek the path to the final fragment..." his eyes shift to swirling pools of darkness "In the Nine Hells it dwells, yes, but not in the circles you might expect to tread. The Pit of Flame holds many secrets, but this one lies deeper still, in Nessus itself, where the Frozen Lord keeps his most precious treasures. But mark these words well - the path to it will not be found through force or fury. When ice burns and flames freeze, when betrayal and loyalty dance as one... there you will find what you seek. The pattern reveals."
We ask him what the artefacts can do together and how that can help us, learning that they possess the power to destroy a god and take their power.
Finally, we ask him what the best way for us to use the wish scroll we’ve acquired will be, and he tells us that he will meditate on the answer, and when we reach into the pool of limbo at some point in the future, we will hear his voice and learn the answer.
He then reaches to some of those within us. Firstly, he recognises that Khada’s goblin blades were forged by a mad goblin smith in ages past, who arrived in Limbo and embraced the chaos to make one blade, before studying the pockets of stability to make another. The elder connects these goblin blades with their true nature, transforming them and revealing ancient goblin runes, naming these blades as The Laughing Edge and The Steel Mind before returning them to our combined hands.
Then he reaches to Pyre, offering a slither of limbo itself to better shape his destiny. He gives Pyre a shimmering, shifting, chiming crystal. This will act as a conduit for wild magical surges. Studying it, Pyre learns that it is a piece of crystallised chaos called the probability prism that can unleash much more chaos if he wants it to.
Lastly, he tells us that to find the fragment we’re looking for here in Limbo we should head to Limbo’s gravitational centre and defeat the corrupted guardian who holds it. We will have the choice to make our fusion permanent or to separate as well. He then closes his eyes and goes back to meditating, and we are escorted out, so we go to rest.
The next “day,” we conduct our morning rituals where possible (Reyk is still on the material plane, but Pyre’s berrykin got merged with us), and Khada meditates with his new blades. Pamykos confirms that the deck of cards Khada drew from the maybe-bag was ordinary.
Having rested, we decide to head out of the city, stopping at the market to buy some healing potions on our way. As we leave the stability of the city, we find ourselves once again surrounded by chaos. We fail to reshape Limbo to our will and find ourselves swept into some water. Good thing we can hold our breath. On our second try, we manage to reshape limbo into a magic carpet, and opened our lunchbox to find a glowing, battered spider leg with a side of sourweed soup to tuck into. We head in the direction we were told to, until in the distance we begin to see energy crystallising until suddenly becoming a chamber of iridescent crystallised glass, and a djinni appears to talk to us. He offers us unhindered passage in exchange for at least one of our participation in an interchange of energies, undergoing transformations and enhancements (something lost, something gained). Pyre is the only volunteer (for now, check this next time). He experiences some visions, makes some choices, and trades 1 strength for 1 charisma. With the fair exchange made, the Djinni vanishes and the crystalline chamber collapses, so on we go.
11/02/2025
The journey through limbo continues as we make our way through the chaotic maelstrom, weathering and resisting the buffeting energies at first. Fragments of memory from all possible timelines wash over us, but we keep our path. As we get closer to our goal, we see two blurry entities struggling.
Getting closer, we see two blurred silhouettes, a human and a tiefling. They appear to be in the same state we were when we arrived! We greet them and ask them how they got here. It seems they were also after the artefact, and having taken out some orcs, they found another note from Fazrahl and another astral orb which brought them here.
With a little prompting from us as well as their own instincts, they merge together, and suddenly our merged form and theirs are magnetically pulled together, merging into one. We learn that they are Yrsa, a Tiefling Paladin of Tyr who chased the orc warband across the sword coast and got pulled into this adventure; and Kalmia, a thief/mercenary who is looking for her mentor who was taken by the orcs.
As one, we head on. The surrounding area becomes more turbulent and we attempt to shape a barrier from the nearby energies. We just about manage it, and our goal comes into view in the distance. One more wave of chaotic energies breaks us apart, and we lose time reforming. We keep our attention through another swirl of alternate timelines.
Finally, we reach the eye of the storm. There’s an ancient-looking door. All around us is a violent maelstrom, leaving the door as the only path. Pyre has us test it with some Brieholder, and Yrsa has us collect and eat it, causing rays to burst from our mouth. Pamykos reads the runes around the door, which are written in Celestial. There are two inscriptions, one large and one small.
"What was split asunder let none unite
Lest chaos reign and order's light
Be dimmed for good by evil's hand
Through time eternal here shall stand
A second smaller inscription sits underneath the main rune markings reading:
"When need outweighs the ancient law
And realms of light begin to fall
The path reveals its secret way
Through paths where chaos holds its sway"
Inside the door, we find ourselves in a mirrored chamber that seems too big for where we are. There are several paths to take, and on a whim we head left, into a hallway where our reflections glare at us. We try to continue going left and the mirrors emit psychic screams that hurt to hear. We turn around and go back to the intersection. Based on the poems from the door, we decide to try turning out the lights. Yrsa casts darkness and it reveals the path straight ahead is the way forward. The next room is crystalline, and our footsteps cause echoing musical chimes to emit from below. The resonance seems more harmonious from the right hand side by Pamykos’ ears, and after testing his Keytar out (which did make an awful echoing mess of noise, but also confirmed the correct path.
Heading down the next corridor and making a delightful harmony, we suddenly find that the next room is inverted, and we are standing on the ceiling. Kalmia and Khada lead an investigation and it seems that the swirling dust in the “right” (from our perspective being upside down) hand tunnel is less turbulent. We pass the next hall without issue, falling to the floor in the next chamber, which has new mirrors depicting scenes from our past. Studying the mirrors, we see that one of them is showing events exactly as they transpired, whereas the others seem slightly… off.
We head through the true one and find a chamber with halls full of ornate frames, the contents of which we cannot see. On a whim, we head left again, and we were right! Unfortunately, we find ourselves in a dark chamber full of unsettling whispers. The left passage sounds extra menacing, the middle one calls us brave, and the right passage was indistinct. We try the right passage and it turned scary quickly as the whispers become cruel and overwhelming. Middle passage it is.
This next chamber has only one way out - a shimmering mirror we can pass through. Traversing it, the maze falls away, and we find ourselves in an open space with 9 floating platforms amidst a chaotic storm. We leap from platform to platform, but when we reach the one in the middle, an eruption of chaos happens in one corner of the chamber, closing off an area of the room. It seems that when it subsides it’ll just pop up somewhere else. After a few more slightly tricky jumps, we make it to the other side, and the chaos recedes, leaving us on solid ground before a big doorway, behind which we can sense the guardian’s presence.
We head inside to see a massive spherical chamber with the guardian, a massive being of pure chaos, floating in the middle with the amulet we seek at the centre of its ever-shifting “body.” The guardian calls us out and the chamber begins to shift as reality tears and warps. We begin to float in a starlit void as crystals orbit around us and pulse with light and magnetic fields. Shaking off the tearing sensation, we enter battle!
Our aspect shifts to a protective aura. Kalmia fires her bow and has us push off from a crystal to attack. Pyre empowers our collective wisdom and draws some energy from a nearby crystal, but the guardian attacks with a chaos beam that causes Khada to phase in and out of this plane. Yrsa closes the gap and summons a spiritual weapon, and Pamykos looses some Eldritch blasts. Reality also shifts again, this time to a fiery realm with erupting lava geysers and floating platforms. Our aspect also shifts to release a burst of flame. Unfortunately, we take a tumble and fall in the lava. Pyre gets us out quickly, and manipulates Limbo’s energy to superheat Yrsa’s greatsword, who gets straight to smiting, as the guardian retaliates with slashing arms. Pamykos also gets in on the smiting game with a wrathful smite, but this guardian feels no fear, and the battle rages on.
18/02/2025
Battle continues. The guardian shifts into a light absorbing form, becoming difficult to see and unleashing tendrils that diminish the surrounding matter and regenerate the guardian’s essence. We also sense that the potency of all nearby magic seems to be reduced to zero! We shift our aspect to unleash another wave of flame and trigger a wild surge that infuses us with vigour while inflicting pain over time (extra chaotic vitality). The environment shifts again, this time to a realm of wind and lightning.
We wail on the guardian with our assorted weapons since magic is out for the time being, and the guardian retaliates, lashing out with its bladed arms, before transforming again into a system of interlocking plates and arms, creating a relatively stable zone around us. We feel our magic returning, but it forms a turret and fires on us. We shift our aspect, generating a veil of shadows for us to hide and strike from. Furthermore the lightning that was once present crystallises into reflective crystals. The crystals also shoot out blinding beams, but we are safe in our darkness. Yrsa unleashes a devastating smite that causes several of the interlocking pieces to drop off of the guardians main body. These fragments reform into smaller constructs and get up to attack us, winding up and rapidly spitting shards towards us.
Yrsa and Khada turn to one of the smaller constructs and dispatch it, his goblin sword unleashing a wild suge that summons illusory duplicates of us. The other smaller construct combines back into the main body. It fires once more with its turret before emitting a wave of energy and transforming again, into an even more chaotic form. We shift our aspect, charging our next melee attack with the rage of the void. The environment also shifts again to an undersea void with crushing darkness and bioluminescent creatures that fire spikes at us, but miss after destroying our last mirror image. Kalmia lunges forth with the void-infused rapier strike, piercing and disintegrating it. This reveals the amulet, which Okurak collects using the mage’s oven mitt. Reality around us stabilises (relatively), and a portal opens, with Master Zith’Rax stepping through it. He congratulates us on our success through strength and unity. He tells us that the amulet had long been a source of disorder here in limbo, and that if we focus on where we wish to go, we can return to our city. 
He also tells us about our wish spell.
"Before you depart, I must share what the pattern has revealed about your wish. The threads of fate show three paths your wish might take, each with its own promise... and price.
If you ask for mastery over your journey, the chaos parts to reveal a way through the planes... though such knowledge draws unwanted attention. Through this path, you would gain the power to traverse the planes at will, to sense the doorways between worlds, yet know that others would sense your passage in turn. The very fabric of reality would resist your passage, extracting a toll in pain with each crossing.

If you seek to fortify your essence, I see a way to strengthen your very being against overwhelming power... yet such protection comes at a cost to your vital force. This path would grant you remarkable resilience, even the ability to deny death itself, though your maximum vitality would be permanently diminished, and healing magics would struggle to mend your altered form.

"If you choose to strengthen your bonds, your unity would grow as the realms align... though such connection leaves you vulnerable. Your combined strength would become extraordinary, allowing you to aid each other with but a thought, and share your life force amongst yourselves. Yet this connection would bind you in other ways - forcing you to remain close, moving as one, and even your very souls would beat as one, sharing the same rhythm in battle which could work for or against you. Your enemies would also find ways to exploit these deepened connections."

The pattern shows these paths most clearly. But remember - a wish bends reality itself, and reality does not bend quietly."
Lastly, he tells us to be swift - a great evil gathers in our home plane. After taking a moment to analyse the amulet Amal’Atsar, Pamykos explains that it allows the wearer to always keep their concentration and resolve, and bolsters their concentration. Yrsa takes it for now, though Pyre may also be interested. Now that the other shield users who might want it are absent, Pamykos also decides to take the shield Gon’Thalor. With that sorted, we decide to warp home to Athkatla. We feel ourselves becoming individuals again, but our time in Limbo has also connected us intrinsically in some way.
As we arrive on the beach in the city’s riverside, we realise something is very wrong. Weeks seem to have passed, and Athkatla has become a nightmare. The new road that was being built on the beach around the city has become a ritual circle filled with dark magic, orcs patrol between piles of corpses and ruined houses.
Pamykos reaches out psychically to Reyk the raven, and the two are relieved to feel each other’s presence, though Reyk is very scared as well. The two exchange a rough sense of what they’ve each been through since they last met. The images from Reyk are blurred, but they tell the grim tale of Athkatla’s fall. The completed ritual circle allowed Fazrahl to absorb the souls of every innocent or powerful person in the entire city before the orcish armies swarmed in to take over.
We’re lucky not to have been noticed yet. We need somewhere safe to make camp until we figure out what’s next. Pamykos has Reyk scout the city for anywhere that might be safe. The Adventurer’s Guild is in ruins, but the slums are full of abandoned homes, their occupants having presumably moved into the homes of deceased nobles. Kalmia scouts ahead and we follow the safest route we can until we find an empty home, so we cram in and rest, setting up shifts.
We manage to sleep through the night, though the sounds we hear are disturbing. We wake to sketchy merchants advertising wares they have ripped from the dead, and panicked citizens selling false guard badges and patrol schedules. We take some time to plan our next moves. From Pamykos’ communications with Reyk it seems touch and go whether or not we can start any fights without things spiralling. We decide to try and sneak our way to the adventurer’s guild to check the ruins for anything useful. Moving past orc patrols and wandering Celestine Dawn cultists Kalmia overhears some wretches huddled in a ruined shop whispering about a new mad king who has taken over the square in highgarden, along with escape routes from the city.
At the Adventurer’s Guild, it seems that anything worth looting is long gone, and the building was burned down. We learn from Tobin the drug wizard (Tobin the Tokin’, perhaps?) that the mad king in the square in Highgarden is none other than Arfan, the gnome who was making doppelgangers for the celestine dawn. With no better ideas we decide to head for Highgarden, and Yrsa convinces Tobin to come with us for some reason.
Kalmia once again helps us sneak our way around as we cut past the government and temple districts on our way to highgarden. The temples have all been desecrated and the government district is supremely well-guarded.
 As if by a miracle, we see Gideon and Rownar motion us over from a building. Gideon, who still seems a little shaken by his experiences after he was separated from us in the prison, tells us that Fazrahl visited him in his cell, and it seems Fazrahl was once a paladin from Gideon’s order of Pelor! Rownar also tells Okurak that the cult found the werebear camp, with a warband led by Okurak’s absentee mother attacking the tribe! Okurak decides to leave to go and help the tribe, giving us the green gemstone, and Gideon resolves to go and convince his Order of Pelor to help. They both promise to return if or when they can.
Rownar says there is little we or they can do to help here, and we should focus on getting the final artifact before Fazrahl can put his newfound power to use - but the exits of the city are not impeded so long as you don’t appear to be anyone of note or in opposition of the cult. We decide that while we can’t save the city and its people, we should still take down Arfan before we leave.
06/03/2025
Highgarden has been festooned with cult markings, and all of the plants are long withered and dead. Arfan has built a command platform in the square, along with a lab. He has several kidnapped nobles kneeling before him with vacant expressions. He’s giving a grandiose speech to a crowd of scared locals when he spots us. He declares he welcomes new specimens for his advanced experiments, and sets some of his experiments to attack us!
Arfan unleashes a cloud of poisonous gas from some vats surrounding his platform, but Khada charges into it to attack one of the experiments with reckless abandon. Kalmia also devastates the monster with a shot from her bow. Yrsa directs a very inebriated Tobin to sling a 6th-level fireball in Arfan’s direction - it hits two of the experiments as well as Khada, who thankfully dodges the worst of it. Arfan’s platform has some kind of shield dome that protects him, but some of the levitation emitters on the vehicle that keep it aloft are damaged in the blast.
Yrsa summons a celestial valkyrie spirit to aid us in battle, which he then directs to attack the levitation emitters on Arfan’s platform. Pyre adds his draconic spirit to the mix as well, and has it attack the platform’s barrier dome, but it glances off. The dragon spirit tries to retreat, but is grabbed by the second of two mechanical arms that shoot out from the platform. Pamykos releases some eldritch blasts at one of Arfan’s creations.
Arfan then releases syringes that empowers his creations into a frenzy. He also clears the poison gas, but has the acid vats shoot jets at Khada, Pamykos, and Yrsa. They dodge the worst of it but still catch some acid, and pools of it also form at their feet! Khada manages to push one experiment away to make space to maneuver around the other one and out of the acid. Tobin, stoned, tries to use Maximilien’s Earthen Grasp on Khada, but he’s too strong for it to grab him. Yrsa wails on the most injured experiment, and her celestial ally continues to strike the emitters, destroying one of them, though the others compensate for its failure and the platform remains aloft. Pyre twists reality, morphing the platform’s mechanical arm into a soft and fuzzy arm, freeing his draconic spirit, before releasing a snowball swarm on the creatures, decapitating one of them. The draconic spirit goes for one of the remaining emitters.
The remaining creatures are swarming Khada and Yrsa, the former of whom is very injured at this point. Pamykos blasts the nearest creature and gives a word of healing to Khada. Arfan then summons an exploding device, scattering Tobin, Kalmia, Pyre and Pamykos as they dive out of the way. He also shoots his creations with another syringe, which ends their frenzy but speeds them up. Khada lashes away at the creation, trigger two wild surges with his laughing edge sword, one of which places a curse of death on the creation, the other changing the local weather to storms to match his riled-up mood. Khalmia fires more arrows and Tobin fires a volley of magic missiles, which when combined with the curse of death from Khada’s laughing edge, brings down the second creation.
Yrsa battles with the third and final experiment, with the aid of the valkyrie. Pyre twists reality to partially weaken Arfan’s barrier, as Pamykos and the draconic spirit whittle away at the emitters. Arfan’s mechanical arms grab the valkyrie and the draconic spirit and begin moving them towards the acid vats. Arfan also releases a stream of poison gas from one of the vats towards Pyre and Kalmia. Khada also pounces on the last creature with a flurry of attacks, his Laughing Edge sword shifting reality so that he can taste colours and see flavours. Tobin’s earthen grasp reaches out and grabs the valkyrie which is currently being grabbed by the mechanical claw, holding it in place. Yrsa bolsters the vitality of herself, Khada, and Kalmia (with Aid) and the Valkyrie pries itself free from the mechanical arm. Pyre then envelopes Arfan’s platform in a 6th-level storm sphere! The shield dome still holds, but the emitters take heavy damage, one of them shattered. Pyre triggers a wild magic surge and polymorphs into one of the Celestine Dawn city guards that is blocking the exits to the square and stopping the crowd from leaving, gaining mechanical fists.
The platform still hovers, but is now only around 20 feet off of the ground, rather than the previous 30, so Pamykos casts Black Tentacles, which erupts from the ground below to grasp at the platform and the emitters. The final creature attacks Kalmia. Arfan calls forth the cyborg guards to attack us, projects a shield onto the final abomination, and releases a displacing shockwave to push us back. He also unleashes a beam of “ultimate power” onto one of the cyborg guards - its eyes are now aglow with power. Khada turns the last abomination into mincemeat, and Yrsa tells Tobin to chill before destroying the penultimate emitter with a javelin, leaving the platform to tilt down until one side of it touches the ground. She then moves to the other side to throw a javelin at the last emitter. The valkyrie attacks the shield dome, which doesn’t break it, but drains power from the emitters and the platform until the shield begins to flicker and fail.
Pyre’s storm sphere obliterates the last emitter. The platform drops to the ground, the shield dome disappearing. Pamykos and Pyre dispel the storm sphere, but Arfan uses Wall of Force to make a ball around himself and starts running away. Pamykos attempts to intercept him with a Psychic Lance, but Arfan counterspells. The two cyborg guards begin attacking, with the empowered one releasing some nasty eyebeams to expend his increased power. Another explosive device hits Kalmia, Pamykos, and Khada, the latter of which then charges the cyborg guards as Kalmia fires her bow at the guards for devastating damage!
Yrsa commands the valkyrie to attack the guards, and it caves in the skull of one guard with its mace. Pyre, still polymorphed into a copy of the other guard, begins beating it up. Pamykos hits Arfan with a stronger psychic lance despite Arfan’s attempts to counterspell. Now incapacitated, the wall of force Arfan was creating fails. Khada and Kalmia pelt the last guard with attacks, felling it.

17/04/2025
Khada charges the stunned Arfan, laying into him. Pamykos hurls vicious mockery, but Arfan retaliates with a lightning bolt that catches all of us, before commanding the vats from his lab to release an electrical field. Yrsa heals some of the damage away with a mass healing word and Kalmia fires her homing crossbow, the tracking bolt seeking out Arfan.
Arfan slams his staff down for a volley of empowered magic missiles, wounding us further, and Pamykos retaliates with more mockery, calling attention to Arfans wounds to name him “Duke Arfan the dying.” Arfan retaliates by making his vats detonate, and after a few more attacks, he teleports a short distance away before trying to run away. However, Kalmia chases him down and grapples him. He tries begging for his life, but after we decide we can’t trust him to not cause more trouble should we let him go and offer him a choice between death and some of Tobin’s strongest mind altering psychedelics, Arfan tells us to kill him if we must, since we can’t grasp the glory that the Celestine Dawn cult aim to bring to the world. As such, Khada kills him. Arfan drops his staff, which is an aspiring staff of Proclamation (a marvel of Arcane engineering), his syringe of action, an Orb of Eccentric Explosion MkII, and 3000G. (Also 12500 XP, which should have been added, but do check).
We also find his journal, with wild theories and technical diagrams on various advanced gadgets. Some of the journal entries are of note. #83 describes the aftermath of the first time we beat him. #87 describes the infiltration of the Athkatla city council and how they used each one’s replacement to enact their plans for the city. #96 describes the implementation of the city-wide festival plan, which included smuggling in many Arkonite crystals to house the souls of the ritual’s victims, and explains that Fazrahl himself has gone to Nessus to collect the final artifact, a sword that can momentarily disrupt any force and seize a god’s power. Arfan notes that should Fazrahl fail to return, he plans to take his master’s place on the throne.
With all of that seen to, we decide to leave the city and find a way to get to Nessus. Pamykos suggests going back to Verbobonc. Ratan helped us open a portal to the Hells last time, when we banished Moryx, so maybe he can help us again? Wearing clothes from Pamykos’ mage armoire, we manage to pass the city guards with no noticeable incident, and begin the journey.
It’ll take us a lot longer to reach Verbobonc on foot rather than by boat, which is how we travelled between the two cities last time. As it is, we make it to the outskirts of Purskull and camp for the night, but we likely will need to head into Purskull to look for transport.
The next morning, we head into town to find it the victim of several raids from the villains in Athkatla. We approach the least terrified/most welcoming person we can find. He’s very wary of us, but Pamykos manages to introduce us and explain what we need. He offers to take us to Verbobonc if we can escort him and his family. We agree, so he and his family gather their last few belongings, along with a few horses, loading up an open cart and hitting the road. Talking on the way, they learn that we are the heroes of Verbobonc, and Pamykos regales the family with stories of our past adventures (editing out the nasty bits). The journey is mercifully uneventful, and we approach Verbobonc to find it looking very much better than we left it.
The guards give us a heroes welcome, Arabella and Ratan rushing out to meet us as they hear the commotion. They’re delighted to see us, but having heard rumours from survivors of Athkatla, they wish it could be under better circumstances. We ask to talk with them somewhere more discrete, and once there Pamykos explains the whole situation. Ratan is most concerned with our news, but says he will help immediately, asking if we’re ready to go. We say we could use some healing supplies and anything else that will help.
He gives us 3 supreme healing potions, 5 superior healing potions, 1 greater invisibility potion, 10 fire resistance potions, and a scroll of Aura of Life, and Arabella bestows us with a greater version of the Bless spell, to help us upon our immediate arrival in Nessus. Ratan leads the way to a chamber where he assembles a ritual circle sigil and opens a portal. We thank Ratan and Arabella for all the help and say we’ll do our best.
We arrive near a massive chasm, acrid air and ominous sights meeting us. We immediately begin feeling the scorching heat of the ground beneath us, so we all drink one fire resistance potion each , granting us protection for the next hour. We’ve arrived on a summoning circle platform at the top of a long path that winds down. The path frequently erupts with lava and brimstone plumes from many fissures, though there are alcoves in the rocky canyon walls offering some cover. A whispering, crimson substance weeps from the walls, and winged fiends flit across the distant skies.
Reyk and the berrykin are not comfortable here either, but are spared the worst of the heat as they aren’t touching the ground, but regardless Pamykos uses prestidigitation to chill some bedding for our pets so they can be safer.
We make our way carefully down the path, but we encounter some chain devils. With few other options, we explain that we are tracking Lord Fazrahl who plans to steal an artifact from the realm. The demons don’t want that, so they’re willing to let us pass, but the leader of the trio says we must pay the protection fee by letting him taste the blood of the sweetest and best of us. By moral definition this would be either Yrsa or Pamykos, but we work out an alternative, with Pamykos offering a vial of dragon’s blood that Okurak gave us when we set off. The devil is very keen on this, taking it gladly and letting us pass. We ask a few more vague questions about the artifact and where we might look. He doesn’t know the artifact, but says that something that powerful would be with Lord Asmodeus himself. We ask the way, and he says mortals don’t normally just pop in, but we’re already headed the right way, and we might find more at Balzog’s Information Emporium at the infernal market along our way.
Carrying on, we reach the market. Heads turn, and several demons are eyeing us as new slaves. One small but aggressive imp blocks our path and demands another protection fee, but Pamykos pretends to be here on the orders of his former demonic companion Moryx the Doombringer, ordering the weakling to stand aside, which it does, frightened. Shortly after, we find the emporium. Balzog is a six-horned goat demon, who demands something of value in exchange for information. However, perhaps shockingly or perhaps obviously, Jizrek arrives at the emporium looking for his favourite customers! What is shocking is how he blasts away one of the guards who tries to grab him! We peruse his wares.
Khada and Kalmia buy a ring of borrowed time and a cloak of the fallen noble for a combined 65g. There’s also a holy symbol of turn (in both meanings of the word) undead (Pyre buys), a long-lasting (8hrs) elemental damage (of our choice) resistance potion with some kind of drawback (which Khada buys 2 of for 100g). Finally, there’s a sword of uncomfortable warmth. We bid Jizrek farewell, and he’s gone the next time we look that way.
We make our way to Balzog, and paying him with cheese (a slice of cheddar as a deposit, then a wheel after the rest of the info and our second and final vial of dragon blood, he tells us where to go and what to do.
He said Kavan’Tuvok is a celestial word and the only celestial thing in Nessus is the Vault of Entombed Light which no demon/devil can step foot upon.
To get there, you must first travel to the forgotten outpost where there is an inactive portal which you must activate. To activate it you need to clear the lava blockage in the NW tower to restart the forge, redirect the flow of lava to the correct channels, align the power crystals to match those of the star charts for the portal nexus you wish to travel to, obtain lava from the receptacles near the crystals and pour them onto the crystals to activate them.
08/05/2025
Still in the infernal market, we look at a map on one wall. The forgotten outpost is further down the path. The portal nexus we’ll travel to from there is south of the harvesting fields, which we’ll have to cross northward to reach the vault.
We take a moment for Pyre to apply some demonic disguises to our party (minus Yrsa), and then decide to do a little more shopping before we continue on. There are merchants selling potions, others selling imps, quasits, puppeteer parasites, abyssal chickens, and more.
Pyre has a test run whipping an abyssal chicken for kicks, and ends up needing to purchase it since he damaged it in the process. Pyre is kicking it along in an effort to stay in character, which causes it to bite Pamykos! Pyre then trades the chicken (and one of Pamykos’ pained tears) for a vial of bottled agony, and Pamykos buys a bottle of crystallised hope. With that, we move on. Pamykos re-analyses Khada’s elemental resistance potions that he bought from Jizrek. They grant 8 hrs of resistance to one element, but also to healing and other positive magic. The heat outside the market is overwhelming and our first dose of potions has worn off, so we (aside from Pyre and Yrsa, who are resistant enough to shrug it off) drink 3 more of our stock of fire resistance potions (4 left).
Continuing down the path, Yrsa investigates the alcoves, where she begins to feel hallucinations creeping in but resists it. She realises that the crimson substance seeping down the walls is whispering secretively, and also spots a vial in the alcove. Pamykos identifies it as some kind of resistance potion, but it’s not clear what kind. Yrsa sniffs the wall fluid, finding it pungent, and then listens to its whispering. The whispers invade her mind and cause fear, pain and weakness. We decide curiosity is more likely to be punished than rewarded here, and press on, stealthily and carefully.
Kalmia spots something on the path that Pamykos recognises from his studies as a Contract Stone, which will grant several hours of fire resistance in exchange for cold vulnerability. To preserve our stock of potions, those of us who would need the potions decide to take the bargain, and we move on. Kalmia then hears the rattling of more approaching chain devils, so we duck into cover to hide as they come past. Yrsa is struggling to hide, but Kalmia hides her with her cloak.
The next obstacle is some particularly furious geysers erupting fire from the ground of the path. The cliff walls on either side are steeply inclined, and we don’t seem to be able to determine the pattern. Pamykos uses his goat legs to scale the inclined wall and walk across. Yrsa climbs after them, carefully avoiding the wall fluid. Pyre, Kalmia, and Khada find a section that seems to erupt a little less frequently and make a run for it, luckily avoiding getting singed. With that we arrive at the forgotten outpost, where there are no obvious signs of life.
Heading in with Yrsa and Pamykos leading the way, we find ourselves in a large chamber that feels unnaturally cold compared to the outside. A ruined teleportation circle lines the middle of the chamber. In front of us lie the crystals, and the other corners of the buildings have the forge and the other portal elements we need to repair or activate to get the portal running.
Exploring, the first room we find looks like an old armory. There’s an impressive looking axe on a pedestal just past 4 suits of armor. Pyre looks for traps and sees nothing, and Yrsa goes to investigate the suits of armor, immediately setting off a poison dart trap. Yrsa spots the remaining pressure plates, warning the others, and then inspects the armor, noticing a complete lack of any gaps. She also detects magic and gets a bad feeling, suggesting that we leave the room unmolested. Pamykos is reminded by the demonic axe of Moryx’s flail and agrees most eagerly.
The next room we find looks like some kind of Warden’s quarters, with a row of cells lining the south. Pyre spots tripwires in the room’s doors, connected to a blade that would slice from wall to wall, which Kalmia disarms with ease. Kalmia spies a safe, but fails to notice the trap on it, releasing a poison mist cloud into the room. Inside the safe are the star charts we need as well as the warden’s journal. The journal describes the procedures to align the crystals, and also defines a password to disable the animated armor in the armory - “Asmodeus Ascendant.” Further entries describe the need to for maintenance in a hostile environment, how the forge works and how the lava powers the crystals, and how the outpost fell around 20 years ago in a conflict between demonic factions.
The cells are mostly empty, but for some scratching sounds. Yrsa demands to know who is there, and a little voice answers. It’s a Kobold named Pizrik(?) who was brought here by his nasty demon master Balbog (Ballbag?), before escaping, and accidentally locked himself in here while searching for rats to eat. He promises to be a good friend to us if we free him, but when we free him he tries to flee, forcing Kalmia to grab him and Pamykos to charm him to calm him down. He offers to show us around and help us dodge traps, including in the armory room.
Yrsa disables the armour and we approach the axe, cautiously observing it. Pamykos struggles to analyse it, but the eyes of its demonic visage blink and its maw opens, demanding that we feed it blood. We scheme to destroy the weapon once the lava flow to the forge is working, so we back away for now.
Pyre clambers up a wall near the forge to get within range, then uses Mold Earth to unblock the lava flow, getting the fuel for the forge going. Yrsa casts death ward on Pamykos, and they go and look in the forge. We identify the channels that need to be opened from the warden’s journal. Pamykos uses his telekinesis to levitate the demonic axe and drop it in the lava, destroying it.
Pamykos then reads the instructions on opening the channels from the journal as Yrsa and Pizrik work the levers, but he makes a mistake twice in a row, sending the lava in the wrong direction and endangering Yrsa and Pizrik! Pamykos surmises that the journal is written in a very peculiar dialect. Pyre takes the book and gets it right this time, and the lava flows the right way.
The charm also wears off from Pizrik, who feels betrayed, but after we explain the situation to him he asks if we can still be friends, to which we (some of us cautiously) agree. It’s time to align the crystals and pour on the lava, but the lava has not yet filled the channels, and Kalmia can hear many small feet approaching. Our efforts must have drawn some attention. Pyre hears the voice of Mephistopheles in his mind, harking back to that time he drew from the deck of many things and made an enemy of the archfiend. Mephistopheles has sent a horde of his lesser minions to greet Pyre. Looking outside the door, it seems that a horde of tiny demons is on the way! They’ll probably arrive about as the lava gets where it needs to.
Pamykos interprets the star charts and the crystal-alignment instructions from the journal, relaying them to Kalmia as she gets the crystals into place. Once the horde is in range, Pyre releases a sunburst, wiping out 4/5ths of them and blinding the rest for a minute. After a few attempts, Yrsa manages to pour the lava and the portal pulses open. She then scoops Pizrik (who is worried at the prospect of going to the harvesting fields) up and we run for the portal.
On the other side, we meet an aged demon who demands payment for passage through the portal nexus. Thankfully, he takes a wheel of cheddar as payment! We exit the portal nexus and pass into the harvesting fields.
We contemplate different means of sneaking across, but Yrsa questions why we don’t just walk across and cut down anything in our way, so off we go. None of the subjugated field worker demons bother us, but an overseer yells at us, demanding to know what we’re doing. Yrsa tries yelling back with thaumaturgy for the overseer to mind his own business, but it doesn’t work and we’re attacked as the demon draws two scimitars and lunges for us. Pamykos retaliates with eldritch blasts as well as inspiring Yrsa, who charges forth with her greatsword. After a few slashes, the demon tries to flee, yelling to raise the alarm, but Yrsa cuts him down.
Before anyone else can engage us, we retreat into stealth. Pyre and Yrsa use invisibility potions and Kalmia and Pamykos sneak along. In a short while, we find ourselves at the Celestial-designed vault. The doors have been busted open by corrupted tendrils matching those we saw in the ruined Athkatla, presumably Fazrahl’s work. Those same tendrils run along the hall before us down to a doorway at the end.
While prepping for the combat with some spell casts (and Pamykos drinking the crystallised hope), Pyre unleashes several wild surges and turns into an ancient gold dragon for 18 seconds, opens a portal to the ethereal plane for 24 seconds, and more.
We gain 8500 XP and level up to Lv17.
22/05/2025
One of the celestial scripts on the vault door describes a ward that has clearly been broken. Another states that “here lies what cannot be destroyed, only guarded,” and that the light always shines in the dark. Stepping inside, we find it much cooler than the outdoors of Nessus. Pamykos studies the tendrils, recognising them as Fazrahl’s work from Athkatla. These tendrils will spread and leech the life from anything they touch over time.
Yrsa summons a celestial valkyrie to support us in the (presumably) coming battle. Kalmia notices no traps, so we proceed down a hallway full of angelic statues that the tendrils are climbing at. We find ourselves in a library full of ancient tomes on the walls and clockwork mechanisms on the floor. There’s a grand door with an inscription, and another surrounding the central mechanism in the room. The gist is that we can find Kavan’Turok, Destroyer of Souls, if we prove our worth in insight, wisdom, and sacrifice.
Yrsa finds a journal from one of the guardians of this place. It describes how Fazrahl, once Fazrael, began his journey to evil after being denied ascension to the title of Pelor’s avatar. The fallen celestial slayed Pelor’s chosen and unleashed a dark ritual before disappearing. The journal also mentions that the artifact is sealed beneath this place’s hall of study.
Looking through the door, we find a chamber full of starlight and three more doors. A dais home to three beams of celestial light states that we must clear the three trials in order. First is sacrifice, which demands that we give up something of real worth, be it an item, or an aspect of ourselves. Yrsa and Pamykos sacrifice some vitality, while Kalmia sacrifices her deception proficiency, and Khada his persuasion skill. Pyre… . With this, we hear the mechanisms back in the study begin to turn.
The next door is wisdom, which bears some strange runes of the door plus an inscription stating that we must play dead to pass, though that last part seems to have been added by someone else. Yrsa tries casting feign death on Pamykos, but it doesn’t work. We try a few other things that don’t work, such as holding our breath, but investigating the runes gives us the answer. It’s musical! Pamykos plays DEAD on his keytar, and the door disappears, the mechanisms in the study turning further,
The final door for the trial of insight houses a statue surrounded by many weapons, and an inscription asking us to bring the weapon that is coveted by kings, ruins warriors, and ends all fights. Yrsa notices that one weapon bears a depiction of an olive branch. Peace ends all conflict, so we choose that one, and we’re correct! Returning to the study chamber, we find the mechanisms have been reconfigured to present a button, which opens a spiral staircase. Heading below we find a hall with just one door, and begin to feel a sense of dread and foreboding. There are no clear signs of traps, so on we press.
Fazrahl awaits, wielding Kavan’Turok in his hand, having claimed it from the gem encrusted pedestal on the far side of the room. Naturally, he wanted us to bring him the other artifacts. We brace for combat, but he freezes time. All at once, a wall of fire springs up between us and Fazrahl, an orb of magic explodes in our midst, and two meteors bombard us. Pyre is already down and the rest of us are on our last legs already!
We retaliate with what attacks we can, but he wields a power that makes our attacks only do minimal damage, and he summons corrupted tendrils that ensnare Pyre and Khada, though Khada breaks free with great effort. Khada then cuts free the unconscious Pyre. An enraged Fazrahl uses Kavan’Turok to drain our souls, instantly killing Pamykos, Yrsa, and the unconscious Pyre. The others decide the best course of action is to grab our collected artifacts and run, but Fazrahl quickly catches up and dispatches them both.
We suddenly become aware again, but all is dark. We have no self, but we experience the universe, seeing visions of Fazrahl going back to Athkatla, conducting another dark ritual to combine the artifacts into Guth’Bani, the god slayer, that tears a hole in reality to enter the celestial realm and slay Pelor, stealing his essence and power. The whole of the forgotten realms fall dark as the sunlight ceases. The artifact disintegrates, its purpose fulfilled, but Fazrahl has achieved divinity. He descends to reside with other infernal, abyssal gods like him. We slowly begin to become aware of ourselves again as our bodies resolidify. We awaken, and before us stands none other than Jizrek.
He explains to us that this is our final meeting with him. He is in fact the long lost and almost forgotten god of Gnoblins, who goes where he is needed. He has long been testing our worth to see if we should receive his power, and that, along with some items, is his final gift to us. He touches us and fills us with incredible power, which he claims will only grow over time, since we have been made lesser demigods! Though this visibly weakens him to his brink. He tells us to seek the gods in the celestial realm, gain their blessings, and challenge Fazrahl one last time. He then opens his pack and bestows upon us some powerful items specifically for each of us. Pamykos assures Jizrek that he will not be forgotten again. With that, he dissipates into mist and fades away.
We awaken in the celestial room of the vault, where the three trial doors are, and the dais in the middle seems to be home to something familiar that wishes to reassimilate with us. Reaching out to touch it, we regain that which we sacrificed for that trial! Furthermore, our new divine power has strengthened us in ways we can scarcely imagine.
29/05/2025
We need to get to the celestial plane to consult the gods. Thankfully, we remember that Zir’Thax, the master of the Gith’Zerai monastery in Limbo, told us that if we use our wish scroll to wish for mastery over our journey, chaos will part and reveal to us pathways between the plains (albeit at the cost of pain as the fabric of reality resists our passage, and that we may draw unwanted attention), Pyre makes the wish for us, and we gain a new power. We can sense that the boundaries between planes are weaker in a sanctified place such as this, and with a short search we find a path that we can traverse if we focus on where we wish to go.
Pamykos recalls that there is a lower celestial plane that, while the gods do not reside there directly, holds links to each of the gods’ celestial palaces. That seems like a good place to start. The passage is painful, but we arrive relatively unscathed. We’re halted by a celestial of some kind that demands to know why we mortals dare to approach the celestial planes. We explain that we seek to bring justice upon the one who slayed Pelor, and we seek blessings from the gods to grant us the power to make it happen. The celestial, whose name is Azlaman, is surprised to note that we have some aspect of divine power about us that is still unfurling, though we remain mortal. He says the gods may be willing to meet us, but he shall have to ask. He departs to go and do that.
As we wait, Pyre orders some food from a celestial attendant, receiving some soup, and ponders what has become of the places we’ve been in the pools of reflection that are nearby. We join him and get glimpses of Hommlet, Verbobonc, Athkatla, Pyre’s home, and Pamykos’ home plane of Theros. Hommlet is more-or-less all right, being far from the danger. Verbobonc has raised its defenses, having been attacked a bit. Athkatla has been turned into a stronghold for the Celestine Dawn, with a dark cathedral having been raised in the centre of the city. A few paladins and druids are massing outside in the woods.
Eventually, Azlaman returns, and explains that a few of the gods are willing to meet us: Tyr, Gond, Mystra, Helm, and Eldath. However, we will only be allowed to visit one, for the time being. We choose Tyr, since his goals of justice would align most closely with our quest, and Yrsa, as a follower of Tyr, could not bear to miss out on this chance. We also promise Pyre that we’ll ask Tyr to bid more of the gods to meet us, so that Pyre can meet his god Gond.
Tyr tells us that to defeat Fazrael the Fallen One we need to weaken his power base. He will grant us his blessing if we venture into Athkatla and defeat his dark priestess, stopping the leylines from being corrupted. Furthermore, on our return there will be an opportunity to speak with one more of the gods, which will probably be Gond for Pyre’s sake.
With that, we return to Alzaman, who can transport us back to our plane, wherever we should go. We decide to travel to the druid and paladin war camp outside Athkatla, where we find Okurak and some werebears; Gideon and some paladins of Pelor; and mother Ayana and her druid circle. They are heatedly debating the plan of attack. The werebears and druids want a full-frontal assault, but the paladins want to send a strike team through the sewers to open the gate first.
We fill (somewhat briefly) everyone in on our situation and our main objective, volunteer to be the strike force, and establish a plan - to sneak in, open the main gate to let the army in, and then we will all cut a path to the cathedral together. As a signal, Yrsa will send up a fireball, and Pamykos leaves Reyk with Ayana to telepathically send a signal, since Pamykos can send the signal to Reyk and Ayana, as a druid, can read Reyk’s thoughts.
We enter the sewers and begin our approach, but we quickly run into Tantin the Tortle. Yrsa and Pyre buy rat kebabs in exchange for directions to the nearest sewer exit to the front gate. We also ask him about current events in the sewers, and he explains that a “scary orc and a scary demon” sometimes come down here and head for the north end of the sewers. Yrsa eats the rat kebab but is thankfully immune to disease, and Pyre gifts Tantin the celestial soup, which he rather likes but still decides to add rats.
We move on, but Kalmia hears footsteps and voices approaching. As they round the corner, we see some demonic-looking orcs, and we ambush them! Yrsa begins cutting them down with her new sword, Pyre unleashes some minute meteors to scorch several of them and Kalmia begins collecting footage for her MLG kill reel montage by multi-killing several orcs with a single arrow. Pamykos rings a charge with some rallying magic from his keytar, bolstering the others to rush in and hit the orcs for a little extra damage. It does not take long to bring the orcs down. They don’t hold much of worth, but they do have celestine dawn cult robes, which we take to aid our infiltration, clearing any obvious blood or damage away with mending/prestidigitation.
With that, we press on. Pamykos uses another Keytar spell, piano/forte, making our sounds half as quiet. We reach the sewer hatch and Kalmia quietly climbs up. The hatch isn’t locked, though people occasionally pass by. There don’t seem to be any normal citizens remaining, only cultists and their demonic orc soldiers. We make our way up and make for the gate, looking like we belong. We pass by a patrol, but aside from having to exchange greetings hailing Fazrahl’s greatness, they do not cause problems for us.
We ascend to the top of the wall, where the entrance to the gatehouse is, where two guards block our path. Kalmia initially tries to deceive them into believing that we are their shift change, but ends up intimidating them into leaving instead, sounding unexpectedly scary (nat 20!) for someone who usually prefers a sneakier approach. Yrsa and Pyre stand guard outside as Kalmia and Pamykos go inside, though Kalmia ends up swapping with Yrsa since we need her strength to open the gate. As the gate opens, Pamykos sends the signal via Reyk and then instructs the raven to be an eye in the sky. The guards on the city wall spring into action as our army of allies outside begins their charge. Reyk relays to Pamykos that the barracks north of the gate are mobilising, and that patrols are heading for the gate.
The battle for Athkatla has begun.
19/06/2025
Our forces are charging into the front gate as the enemy attempts to mobilise their defences, but three groups of four enemy corrupted celestial guards each have spotted us, and are advancing up the stairs of the city wall. Pamykos uses his keytar to unleash a thunderous scream that pushes the first group tumbling down the stairs before stepping back. The enemy regroups and reaches the top of the stairs.
Pyre uses Hokoki’s amulet to cast Ice Storm on all of the guards, and he quickens the spell so he may cast again. This strikes all of the enemies, but a wild surge reverses his gravity and sends him skyward, forcing him to use freedom of the winds as his second spell, instead of the storm sphere he was planning. Khada charges in with a flurry of sword attacks, slaying one celestial but also accidentally catching himself in the process. Kalmia duels some of the second group with her rapier before slipping through the fight to get some range. Yrsa fells the rest of the second group with her shiny new radiant soul greatsword. Kalmia, acting quickly, fells another celestial with a bolt through the head. Pamykos empowers his keytar with psionic energy and begins wrathfully smiting the third group. Khada fells another enemy before shoulder checking the last of that group off of the city wall, sending them plummeting to their doom. Pyre scorches the final group with burning hands before Yrsa slices them in half with her greatsword.
With our skirmish done, we can see that the battle raging below is quite evenly matched. A cleric is sent to the dark cathedral to alert the high priestess. Okurak spots us and says he will join us and that we must make for the cathedral. As we make our way past the battle lines, Pamykos uses his Keytar to unleash a Crescendo of Dextrerity, empowering our forces to fight and move faster. This hastens us on our race to the cathedral and helps turn the rest of the battle in favour of our forces.
As we enter the temple district and head for the sickly green glow of the dark cathedral, we make our preparations for battle with the priestess. Not long after, the spoon of warning begins to buzz and we hear footsteps. We ready some spells, and three savage looking orcs turn the corner. All three are enveloped in a sickly green aura of power. One is a wizard of some kind, and the other a warrior. Okurak’s face snarls in recognition at the lead orc, the high priestess and Okurak’s mother, the Demon of the Dale. She offers for Okurak to join her, but of course he’s not interested. He spits at her, disgusted at her for abandoning him and for being so evil. She vows to defeat us and teach Okurak a painful lesson.
Kalmia wastes no time, firing a bolt that rips through the high priestess’s shoulder, causing her to bellow in rage. Pyre follows up with a twinned firebolt at the priestess and her mage companion, and also unleashes a surge that he had stored previously in the prism of probability, which fires a random spread of 11 magic missiles. The demon of the dale retaliates with a wave of necrotic energy that strikes all of us except for Kalmia, though Pyre dodges the worst of it. She also tries to command Okurak to join him, but he resists. All three of the Demon and her companions resist Pamykos’ mind whip, and she retaliates by striking Yrsa, though she retaliates with a hellish rebuke. The warrior with a club is also able to cast things, as it turns out, and he casts Flamestrike, which Kalmia dodges and some of us resist. Khada lays into the Demon of the Dale with many slashes of his swords, nimbly dodging her retaliation, though the demon does dodge another shot from Kalmia. Yrsa heals everyone up with a mass healing word and restores herself with lay on hands.
The Demon of the Dale fails to counterspell Pyre’s sunburst. It blinds and scorches her, and would have done the same to the club-wielding warrior, but he seems to be totally immune to the spell. The mage resists the worst of the sunburst’s effects. Pyre continues to be hurt by casting so many spells after the wish, and a wild surge scatters all of us and the Demon with random teleportation! Despite being blind, she wails on Yrsa, having landed next to her, though she is then incapacitated by a psychic lance from Pamykos, though she seems to resist the worst of the damage. The orc mage then drains our life force and uses it to heal the Demon and the warrior-healer, though this spell seems to weaken the mage, so they probably can’t do this often.
Yrsa is brought down by this life drain, but Pamykos uses the Final Chord to restore her to consciousness and to blast the club-wielder and the mage. Everyone (except for Pamykos of course) has a bardic inspiration.
03/07/2025
Pamykos follows up on his final chord with a volley of eldritch blasts at the club-wielding healer, though only one hits. The club-wielder then unleashes a massive heal on herself and the demon of the dale. Khada retaliates with a flurry of slashes, one of which triggers a wild surge that stops time for everyone except for him and the enemy healer. The two then duel it out until time resumes. Khada triggers another wild surge that makes him grow in size and strength, but the healer prays to Lord Fazrahl to aid and is majorly healed again, though it seems to take something out of her. This 1v1 rages on for a couple more rounds, which includes a third wild surge, though this one permanently reduces Khada’s maximum HP by 1, rather than doing anything beneficial, though Khada’s Titan’s Grip Gauntlets also made his attacks blindingly strong, so the healer can’t see right now. The healer calls for one more heal from Fazrahl, though this one seems less effective. Time then unfreezes and Khada shrinks to normal size.
Kalmia strikes the demon of the dale with arrows and attempts to use her shadowy veil to sway the Demon to attack to her allies, though that doesn’t succeed. Yrsa provides a mass healing word to us all, followed by a lay on hands heal for herself. Unfortunately, the Demon of the Dale retaliates and knocks her unconscious again. She then runs to Pyre for one last attack, risking a attack of opportunity from Okurak, though it misses. Okurak gives chase after his mother and furiously mauls her. Pamykos calls the Demon of the Dale “The Demon of the Fail” in a vicious mockery, but she seems unperturbed. The enemy mage looses chain lightning at Pamykos, Khada, and Kalmia, though Pamykos dodges the worst of it and Kalmia dives out of the way. The healer cures her wounds once more, though this latest heal is rather weaker than her previous efforts.
Khada continues wailing on the healer with his swords, and uses the strength of his gauntlets to shatter the ground beneath the healer and the mage multiple times. The healer barely manages to remain standing, but the archmage is knocked prone. The mage, standing back up, launches two magical blasts each at Khada and Pamykos. Kalmia uses her tracking shots on the demon of the dale. Pyre escapes from close quarters combat with the demon by using freedom of the winds. The demon finally manages to exert some control over Okurak before running over to Pamykos and knocking him unconscious with several strikes. Thankfully, Okurak wrests control of his mind back from his mother, shifts back into human form, and then heals Pamykos, who then strikes the demon of the dale with his keytar.
Khada drinks a potion of supreme healing before attacking the healer some more. Kalmia finishes the healer off with two crossbow bolts, the first ripping away half of the enemies face, the second knocking what’s left of her head off. Pyre revives Yrsa with a potion of supreme healing from Yrsa’s kit, and then attacks the archmage with a fire bolt.
The demon of the dale knocks out Pamykos again, and then runs over to attack Khada, though Okurak gets another attack of opportunity in. Okurak revives Pamykos once more. Pamykos then casts a mind whip at the demon and the archmage, though the demon teleports away, so only the mage is affected. Khada brings the archmage down to his last gasps of strength. The demon hits Kalmia with a necrotic wave, though Pyre bends luck in her favour. The archmage offers some retaliation against Khada with two more magical blasts, but nothing deadly. Yrsa casts a max-level healing word before re-engaging the demon of the dale in melee combat with her greatsword. Kalmia slays the archmage with a headshot. Pyre misses with two twinned firebolts. The demon of the dale knocks Yrsa out again. Okurak revives Yrsa, but shifts into a werebear again in the stress of this combat.
Kalmia takes careful aim and fires a shot so perfect it creates a sonic boom on impact, shattering all of the nearby windows and immediately vaporises the demon of the dale’s head (172 damage!!!). Okurak drops to his knees in mourning by his mother’s corpse, though Pyre and Pamykos offer him some comfort. We also revive Yrsa, and level up! (Set XP to 270,000)
The battle for the city begins to come to an end and a chorus of cheers (of a heroic kind, not the demonic kind) rises up and heads in our direction. Some of the paladins and druids, including Ayana, reach us, declaring victory, and heal us all up. Together we resolve that we still need to cleanse the leylines and destroy the dark cathedral. As we make our way towards the entrance, however, we begin feeling more and more queasy as we bathe in the sickening green glow that emanates from the cathedral. Ayana begins preparing a ritual
Pyre contemplates whether or not a sunburst might cancel out this vile light with some better ones, and Pamykos speculates based on arcane knowledge that that might be a good train of thought, since this necrotic magic is coming from a source point somewhere inside the cathedral that we’ll need to affect to stop this aura. Pyre wades through the sickening light to the door. Investigating it reveals nothing, but it’s not locked. As he opens the door, a wave of necrotic energy washes over him, but he persists. Pyre can now see a shrine to Fazrahl inside holding a gemstone, so he tries his sunburst. The gem shatters in a massive wave of necrotic energy that hurts us all quite badly, but the healers in our army go to work. Ayana and the paladins are confident that they can handle cleansing the area and restoring balance to the other temples from this point.
Our war party has found a selection of extremely useful magical items that could help either with rebuilding the city or in our battles to come. We are offered first pick of one thing each, with the rest going to aid the repairs. {Insert our choices of items here}. The last thing on our to-do list before going to see Tyr is to restore the natural flow of energy. We all link arms and channel our shared divinity, pulling unlimited energy from the world to wash away all of the corruption.
10/07/2025
We bask in victory! Some of the locals recognise us as the heroes of Verbobonc, others decide we should be the saviours of Athkatla instead, but finally we are bestowed the title “The Chosen of the Realms.” We talk with the surviving city folk for a bit as some of the paladins and druids begin discussing rebuilding the city and setting up a new democratic system. Then we go shopping, selling some of our old, unused magical items to buy some new ones along with a large stock of healing potions.
We decide to go for a celebratory drink. Kalmia drinks some Eldritch Wine and ages 7 years. Pyre drinks some as well and starts disco dancing. He also orders some Mordenkainen’s risky whisky for Yrsa, Pamykos, and Khada, though Yrsa declines, so Kalmia takes her shot. Khada limbs are twisted into strange angles for a few days, Pamykos’ next damaging spell becomes a healing spell, so he eldritch blasts himself and gets up feeling even better! Kalmia’s shot grants her her own personal thundercloud and rainstorm for the next 3 days. The celebrations go on into the night.
The next day, Pyre sets to work on his new Golem, while the rest of us help out with the city’s recovery efforts. Khada helps move the bodies (and loots some coin purses from the dead orcs in the process). Pamykos motivates the repair crews with some morale-raising music (and earns a discount on some of the city’s shops). Kalmia entertains the children with sleight of hand close-up magic tricks, enabling their parents to work harder. Yrsa sadly is hung over and doesn’t manage to be much help with healing the wounded (I rolled a nat 1, sorry), so she spends the next few days praying to Tyr. Pyre also spends some time working with Hokoki’s box and playing with his berrykin, and Pamykos spends some nice time with Reyk, but isn’t able to deepen their psychic connection in full.
After a few days, once Pyre’s golem is complete, the time has come to move on. We bid a fond farewell and good luck to our friends and allies before we use our power to seek a pathway back to the lower celestial plane. The journey is as painful as ever, but we arrive otherwise unmolested. Alzaman the celestial is waiting for us. He notes that the realms are stirring from our successes, and takes us to see Tyr once more.
Tyr welcomes us back and exclaims that he has felt our actions shift the scales of balance. He says he has more he wants to discuss with us, that we should ideally have come back sooner for, but that can wait until after we have completed our second task. Regardless, Tyr gives us the blessing he promised.
We decide to meet with Mystra next. She tells us that we have chosen well. Fazrahl is unleashing corrupting magical threats throughout the realms, but the greatest of these is building in Waterdeep. She shows us that energies are building up in the heart of the city as Fazrahl aims to rip open a tear between planes and let a terrible entity through to the material plane. We will need to slay waves of monsters that are coming through the first small tears in reality from four different lower planes (including some of the hells and such). If we seize something of the essence of these creatures (anything physical will do), we can then connect our divine essence to that of each of the four planes, destabilising and severing the portal’s connection to each of the four planes. She also promises to discuss her thoughts on this incident in relation to Karsus’ folly, the previous time a god’s power was usurped, on our return. With that, she vanishes and Alzaman leads the way to a portal to Waterdeep.
31/07/25
The interplanar travel is as painful as ever. We arrive in Waterdeep to see three groups of wraiths have just arrived ahead of us and are flying around terrorising people. The rift created by Fazrahl has blasted away the stalls in the marketplace, flattening them and clearing a wide area. We go to work battling the wraiths. Yrsa charges in and slashes at the first group with her greatsword, summoning a spiritual weapon to fight alongside her. Kalmia uses her divine momentum to finish off that group and destroy the next one, as well! Pamykos and Pyre whittle away the next group into nothingness with eldritch blasts and fire bolts, plus some blows from Pyre’s golem, which Pyre overcharges with Tyr’s divine smite of justice.
As we celebrate our victory over the first wave, we see another rift circle begin to open. Pyre has his golem retrieve some rags from the remains of the wraiths for us to use to seal the portal. Pamykos surmises that if we cast the rags into the portal and at least two of us place our hands upon the portal rings we can pour our divine energy through and destabilise the first portal. Pyre and Pamykos do this, and with our powers combined, the first portal (which presumably lead to the shadowfell, judging by the wraiths) is closed. However, the second portal is opening. Pyre tries to surmise which plane it links to, but isn’t able to discern anything precise beyond that it links to one of the hells. We take up positions as the new portal opens and a mixed assortment of devils come through.
Yrsa begins attacking the first group, but Kalmia uses more of her divine momentum to instakill two whole groups again (rogue critical hits are an experience, 180 damage!!!)! Pamykos and Pyre begin slaying the devils in the final group with a psychic lance plus a blow from the keytar, and a fireball, respectively. Pyre’s golem unleashes poison breath on the last group as well, finishing off the last group. With that dealt with, Pyre and Pamykos scrape some devil goo from Yrsa’s face (splattered as a result of Kalmia’s sonic boom and toss it into the portal, communing with it to close it. However, a third portal opens and a horde of skeletons pour through.
Yrsa catches this wave with a flame strike but they all dodge the worst of it before charging us. Some go for Pamykos, but Yrsa is mobbed by three of the groups. Kalmia rains fire on the skeletons, and charms one of the groups to fight for us with her veil of shadows. Pyre unleashes a snowball swarm and some minute meteors on one of the other groups, and his golem attacks the other. Yrsa’s green flame blade dances across two of the groups, but they remain active. Kalmia slays a group with another critical hit (168 damage this time)! Pyre sets up a delayed blast fireball and has his golem keep attacking. Yrsa uses turn undead to scatter the skeletons, sending them running into the perimeter the town guard has created and allowing us to attack them more freely, at least for the moment. Pyre, Pamykos, and Kalmia dispatch the third group of skeletons, while the second group continues to flee and is attacked by Yrsa, her spiritual weapon, and Pyre’s golem. Pamykos finishes off the third group with a smite from Tyr, scoops up some bones, and runs over to the portal ring to close this particular rift, since the next one has begun opening!
Unfortunately, as Pyre fells the last skeleton, a massive clawed hand comes through the final portal, and a great demonic beast emerges with a mighty roar. It declares itself to be none other than the true form of Moryx the Doombringer! With all his full might, he aims to cleanse this city and then the rest of the realms, and he will take particular pleasure in consuming the soul of his former host, Pamykos. Pamykos declares that he knew this day would come, and while Moryx has grown stronger since they last met, Pamykos says that he has grown so far beyond Moryx.
Moryx steps on Pyre’s delayed blast fireball, but it has no effect on him thanks to his hellish resilience. Pamykos is caught in the blast, however, and left quite badly wounded. Thankfully, our heroes are quick to act. Pyre catches Moryx with Hold Monster, and we follow up with a massive amount of damage from Yrsa’s divine smite (with added Tyr’s smite) and some attacks from Pyre’s golem that all critically hit the paralysed dark lord.
As a legendary action, Moryx attempts to possess Pamykos, but Pamykos resists. Unfortunately, Moryx is strong enough to break out of hold monster early, and he unleashes a flaming roar that burns us all, knocking Pamykos unconscious. Pyre puts up a wall of force between most of us and Moryx, and then has his golem feed Pamykos a supreme healing potion. Moryx unleashes a powerful psychic gaze at Pyre, inflicting intense pain, but he manages to keep the wall up. Unfortunately, Moryx flies over the wall and lands on us, scattering us to the side. Yrsa retaliates with a divine smite, but two more skeletal horrors emerge from the portal, as we still haven’t been able to close it!
