Party finds a letter relating to preparing the ritual:

It has detailed information on types of runes to use, along with placement of subjects around the outside of the circle. It has basic information about the importance of doing it on a full moon, as this is when energy through the power lines are most powerful.

Walk down a corridor and find the wainwright turning into a frost zombie
Felrith betrays us and starts fighting for the Celestine Dawn - tries to hit Rinbor
We kill the frost zombie pretty quick with lots of crits, but then everyone rolls low for a while and it takes a long time to kill the enemies - eventually Felrith crit fails and kills himself
Session 9
Killed everyone, axe of the big guy (Garrush confirmed) turned into a staff - it will turn into your weapon eventually and does something else

Ozdos gets Helm relic Sword of Radiance

Notes in the journal:

That idiot Treyton blew his cover and crawled back snivelling and wounded. Pathetic! Lord Fazrahl dealt with him. I'm glad we are moving out to Athkatla soon so I won't have to put up with his stench for much longer. We will find more sacrifices there, he needs more power.

I will have to find more reliable subjects to aid us. Still, the others served their purpose. With any luck I won't have to put up with that viperous "giknuk", "Demon of the Dale" or Akuji and his filthy halfbreeds, the snivelling dog. I will put up with their disrespect for now to achieve the power I was promised, then I shall pay them back in full and wreak havoc upon the "better" races who have ever looked down upon me. 

The sooner the better, although there is no timeline on the delivery of Lord Fazrahl's promises and we are not needed for several days now. Little do I know of the alignment of the fates and why we had to wait this long but it must be soon, he grows in power even outside of the rituals.

Garrush

Take the blacksmiths daughter back to Homlette
Elder tells us about scream to the south of the village
Can’t find old bum
Session 12

Investigated south, a dryder, 2 werewolves and a spider

Rescued Old Bum from one of the web sacs and he gave us a turnip, expressed some interest in seeing the city and meeting Jizrek.
Session 13
Old Bum is staying with us
Tavern - woman named Terissa(?) comes in and buys Sirrush a drink and ask them a load of questions, including where Sirrush is from.

Spiked drink - Infatuated, Sirrush leaves old bum with Pyre at the tavern and chases after Terissa, who tries to run when the others’ suspicions become apparent. Sirrush tries to go with Terissa to the dragonborn, but she flees again when the others give chase, disappearing into the woods.

Pyre wakes up to find Old Bum massaging his feet (Old Bum has a foot fetish?), and Old Bum has a tiny scar on his forehead from being kissed goodnight by Sirrush. Moryx is still in control.

The next morning, the village elder tells us the guards saw a woman sneak out of the north gate towards Verbobonc last night, not long after we turned in.

We decide to return to Verbobonc, and on the road we meet a local ranger who recommends an alternate route from the normal one, saying it’s quicker. After saying our goodbyes, we decided to stick to the normal road. Next, we find a bard playing a lute and singing as they walk along the road. We are all inspired by their song (+inspiration for the whole party! Don’t forget to update ozdos and adalene with this).

Arrive in verbobonc, the guard at the gate, Genryn, recognises us, and when asked about Terissa, says he saw someone like that enter the town yesterday with two familiar, shady humans, one of whom had boils all over his face (Johnson Johnson after our trick on him?). In order to try and keep Sirrush safe from the thieves’ guild’s wrath, we hide them in the back of the cart until we reach the Bridgewalk tavern, the plan being to lend Sirrush Ozdos’ circlet of humanlike appearance for a little bit.

Sirrush uses the circlet to turn into an attractive 54 year old human woman of average height with green skin, short brown hair, a deep voice, grey eyes, they decide to go by “Sirrusha.”

Pyre and Adalene go to see Ratan and Goblon, learning that Goblon is ok and happy, though Ratan has been testing him a little bit here and there (poking him in Goblon’s words). They also learn that he likes to drink “Jizzards Jizzit” and Pyre gives him a random slice of cheese as a snack, which turns out to be the prank cheese that causes Goblon to fart fire. Goblon is upset by the “nasty trick” but accepts it was an honest mistake and accepts the offer of a drink later.

Ratan also says he will ask his contacts if anyone can help us appease or calm the thieves’ guild, but suggests that we lay low or get out of town for a bit in the meantime.

Check the jobs board:
Furrownose Dieg wants a goblin lair cleared, he lives at E8 (Dieg Manor)
Noises in the catacombs
Something in the fields.

Some 16-18yr old guy starts yelling at Ozdos saying that his relic sword should be in the museum Segenn’s collectibles (A6). Guy is Yakti, the curator Segenn’s son. States that it should be for all to enjoy. Ozdos says that he has been ordained to use it by the order of Helm for the common good, but that he has taken Yakti’s opinion on board. Yakti get’s huffy and walks off.

Back at the tavern we decide to handle some of the jobs board tasks and then if need be to leave town the next day and head to investigate the mines. First though, we decide to head to the market to get Old Bum some new clothes/stuff and some turnips, and to meet Jizrek (and get a magical turnip for Old Bum??)

Sirrush buys 5 turnips for 20 silver as a gift for Old Bum. Sadly Jizrek has no magic turnips but says he will find some! He was excited to meet Old Bum as a new customer but dismayed to learn that Old Bum has no money. Nonetheless, he sells an Amulet of Biting to “Sirrusha” for 5 gold and 2 kisses. Jizrek catches the kisses on some handkerchiefs to keep for later. Pyre takes Old Bum to a tailor and buys him a Butler Outfit and an Aristocratic Outfit for fancy occasions at 15 Gold cost. Moryx’s mind is blown by the spectacle.

Go to see the farmer in the fields for the jobs board task. Mark Barrenthorn. Found his animals slashed to pieces but not eaten. Takes us to see the remains from last night’s attack. Animal corpse covered in slash marks. Adalene assesses the marks and determines that this did not appear to be a humanoid attacker. Moryx doesn’t detect any magic in the wounds (low roll).

Animals normally left fenced up in the field. Searching the field reveals tracks heading into the field towards one of the scarecrows. Moryx determines that said scarecrow is a construct, and the scarecrow attacks, paralyzing Moryx with its gaze.
After the fight (and after checking the other scarecrows in the fields), Barrenthorn says that a rival farmer of his, Barrendeer, could have done this to stamp out the competition and because they have similar names and Barrendeer doesn’t like that. He asked us to investigate. Moryx expressed a desire to annihilate Barrendeer, but Barrenthorn just wanted the situation resolved and to be compensated.
 1000XP - Level 6!
Session 14
Short rest in Barrenthorn’s fields before walking over to the other farmer Barrendeer’s fields.
“Sirrusha” and Adalene initially attempt to trick Barrendeer (whose scarecrows are normal) by acting like tourists wanting to buy produce but it doesn’t work, so Moryx moves to threaten him, but he unleashes some kind of fleshy golem that’s impervious to physical attack, even a crit from Moryx’s flail!
It is hurt by magic though, as evidenced by Sirrush’s magic missile. The fire of Moryx’s hellish rebuke also disorients it. The golem is also controlled by the farmer who is stood in the back holding a magic stone of some kind, which Ozdos commands him to drop, and Sirrusha blows the stone up with another volley of missiles.
Interrogating Barrendeer after the fight reveals he got the golem and scarecrow from a wizard named Karthanor, who he met at the blind beholder.
Terrified of Moryx, Barrendeer agrees to pay Barrenthorn 60 gold of compensation for the dead animals, promising not to do anything of the sort again, and Moryx seals the deal by pretending to cast a “death contract” ritual which will bring all the hells upon Barrendeer if he acts up again (Nat 20 Deception!)

We receive:
A decanter of endless water
800 XP
We visit Ratan to ask about Karthenor, only to find that Karthenor is visiting Ratan at this exact moment! Moryx expresses interest in having an army of constructs to conquer the plane, but they are too expensive and Karthenor is less interested in being conquered. On the affordable side, Karthenor offers Rat constructs (50 Gold) and Flesh Golems (1000 Gold). He gives us his card, which will let us communicate with him by tapping it 3 times.

We then decide to help “Sirrusha” investigate the docks to search for Terissa, the suspicious woman from Homlette, using a potion to change Sirrusha’s voice to better fit her appearance. Jizrek is happy to sell such a potion, which is drunk without hesitation. Sirrusha’s new voice is lovely, that of an actress they once met in their travels. However, they now have very foul-mouthed tourettes that spouts personal insults. The potion lasts 2 hours.

Pyre (and also Moryx) decide it’s worth acquiring pictures of what will then transpire when Sirrusha goes into The Electrum Eel to find the lady and the thieves’ guild. Working with Karthenor and Jalla, constructing a frame and added Moryx’s sheets of parchment, Pyre invents a magical camera of sorts, which when oiled parchment sheets are added can be activated to capture images. We had to buy Marshmallows from the market as payment for Karthenor.

“Sirrusha” goes into the electrum eel and somehow manages to seduce a very drunk horny man through the insults into helping them look for Terissa, but he hasn’t seen anything useful. He starts following them about, and when Sirrusha asks the barkeep, he tells her he doesn’t know and says to clear off. Sirrush then bribes the barkeep and learns that Terissa is indeed hanging out with Johnson Johnson (who has come down with an affliction) and the Thieves’ Guild and that they’re at the Laughing Rogue hostel. Sirrush leaves, and Pyre and Moryx, having taken two amusing photos of Sirrusha and the drunk man, follow from a distance, but lose sight of them when one of the raven eggs hatches! Moryx names it Skrípi (Norse word for terror/horror), rushes to the market to buy a large gothic cage for three ravens, a bag of meal worms to feed them, and a glove to handle them for 17 gold, before returning to the tavern to make the baby raven comfortable. Moryx also collects a medical kit for Adalene, since Pyre asked him to while he was there. Moryx then stays at the tavern to imprint on the baby bird, saying he’ll turn it into the best little evil minion.

At the laughing rogue, Pyre orders some Dragon Pineapple Juice, which has quite the kick. Sirrusha ends up with some disgusting grog that looks delightful to them (Nat 1). She found a curtain behind which Johnson Johnson may be sat and hangs out there, swearing profusely due to the potion. This eventually angers Johnson and their compatriots enough for one of them to push her over. In retaliation, “Sirrusha” punches that one hard, earning laughs and respect from Johnson Johnson and Terissa, who invite her to sit.

Sirrush sits down with more of the terrible grog for their new drinking buddy. Terissa isn’t saying much, but they arrange to meet with “Sirussha” under the name of “Carly” again the next day (same time + place), offering “Carly” some work as muscle. (This won’t work as planned because the circlet wears off at dawn).

To finish off for the night, the group goes to and arrives at the fighting pits at the Blind Beholder in the evening. Pyre learns about the betting on fights, with Sirrusha intending to be the fighter being bet on. Pyre collects Adalene to heal Sirrusha between fights.

Session 15
The tavern brawls -  Sirrush wins 8 loses 2. Lost to Horny Henry and The Mighty Sandro. Antics that night included Moryx hexing the doppelgangster (not that it helped much), Moryx and Pyre taking lots of photos of everything that’s going on, Goblon farting more fire, etc. Party goes back to tavern to spend the night. Moryx still in control.

1125 XP.

Session 16
We awake the next morning to find that the other two ravens have hatched! The first one is looking much bigger and stronger than the others, with one being more normal and the last being a little skinny/weaker. Moryx expresses a little disdain at its weakness, but is determined to forge into an evil minion nonetheless, and feeds the ravens some more worms over breakfast. The normal-looking raven is named Harmr (norse for Grief), and the weak little one is named Reyk (norse for Smoke). Sirrush uses the circlet of human appearance again and becomes an attractive 100 year old man with olive skin, long red hair, a deep voice, and grey eyes.

The party plans to visit Ratan and conduct business in town before heading north to investigate the mines and the church of the ascended. At Ratan’s, Ratan tells us where to find a druid (much to Moryx’s disappointment) that can care for the ravens while the party is busy (Moryx begrudgingly agrees to speak with them), identifies Sirrush’s amulet of biting that they got from Jizrek (triple crit chance, but all hits received are crits, 1500g to fix the negative), and provides some information on the church of the ascended and the mines - today is the day of the church of the ascended taking people to their base, and Ratan has heard of the mine’s issues and the missing ore, but doesn’t have any more info. We talk to him about Karthenor’s constructs being used for ill, but Ratan explains that Karthenor was not aware of the farmer’s ill intent and is an honest fellow.

Head to the markets next - buy a sombrero for Goblon to protect him from light, and more glass phials for Sirrush’s acid. Ozdos arranges to send a bouquet of flowers to Arabella from Ratan with a romantic message. (2 silver). Jizrek shows off a book of powerful spells including fireball, hold person and even wish! Hearing that wish is on the cards, Moryx buys the book for 5 gold. There appear to be a few small errors in some of the incantations (magic missile and mage armour as examples from Pyre’s and Sirrush’s knowledge), though Moryx deems 5 gold a small price for the potential the book could offer. He tries to contact Karthenor about the book for more information, but has to leave a message.

We post a message on the jobs board looking for alternative carers for the raven to this druid, offering 1g per day, but then decide to head to see the druid anyway for today (and to ask about the pot of awakening that Ozdos has, we’d forgotten about that!) The druid turns out to be Tamara, a druid of Auril, an evil winter goddess! Moryx and Tamara speak privately and come to an arrangement, signing a blood pact to seal the deal. Tamara will care for the ravens and disguise her appearance as Moryx to grow the raven’s imprint upon him, in exchange for 1.5 gold per day of care and Moryx agreeing to perform the occasional task for Auril, stating that while Moryx serves no god, that his personal goals may align with Auril’s.

As for the pot of awakening and the plant in it, Tamara reveals it has been neglected (probably us forgetting to water it!), and offers to try and help it recover for 5 gold plus a day or two’s work. She says that there is life growing within, which may soon emerge with proper attention. Pyre takes the plant off of Ozdos into his care before leaving it with the druid.

We decide to go sell the amulet of biting to the museum, Pyre changing appearance to look like “Sirrusha” from last night, to pretend to be Sirrush the Old’s younger companion to do the deal (Pyre has better deception), but on the way there we stop to help a lady fix her cart, in exchange she lets us all draw a card from her magic deck.
Sirrush draws the queen of clubs and feels dread, but nothing else seems to happen. Pyre draws the queen of spades, and see’s Mephisto/Mephistopheles, the most powerful arch-devil and hell’s greatest wizard, who glares at him with fury, declaring that Pyre has made a powerful enemy. Moryx tries to say hello, but Mephistopheles snubs him and vanishes, making Moryx mad. It gets worse when Moryx draws the ace of clubs and becomes permanently weaker (-2 to AC forever, only removed by a god or by a wish spell). Adalene draws the jack of clubs and is judged on her life so far, gaining 5 permanent health. Ozdos draws the jack of diamonds, opening a portal to an angel exploding with radiant light, who also declares that he has made a powerful enemy.

Pyre, Ozdos, Moryx, and Sirrush draw again. Pyre got the queen of hearts and is allowed to ask one question of Gond the gearsmith (their god) at any point from now. Ozdos’ card meant they had to draw two more, receiving a jack and ace of spades - making someone’s opinion of them change and gaining the healer feat respectively. Sirrush drew a king of spades, summoning a pile of 3000 gold pieces at their feet. Moryx got a king of diamonds, and summoned an adamantine chain shirt +2 at his feet, which nicely compensates for their now weakened defensive abilities.

Pyre changes his mind and decides to go to Jalla’s and tinker some, and the others continue on to the museum to discuss Ozdos’ sword (since Ratan said Segun would listen about the matter), and Sirrush decides they might spend half of their 3000 gold to get the downside of their amulet fixed instead of selling it. In the museum, Ozdos sorts out the matter regarding the sword with Segun, who makes his son Yakti apologise, and the Segun tells a tale to Ozdos of an even more potent sword that can be found to the north - the Sword of Blinding Light. He then shows off some of the highlights of his collection - including a jewel that may contain the soul of a previous emperor (it certainly emanates life magic at least).

Sirrush gets the negative effects of their amulet of biting removed, haggling Ratan down from 1500g to 1350g. We then consider going to see Arabella quickly and see whether she got the romantic letter from “Ratan.”

Session 17
Pyre comes back from tinkering at Jallas as we leave the museum and head off to see Arabella. He has produced glowing magic rope!
We check on Arabella and learn that Ratan has taken the forward step to ask her out, and that they are meeting in the woods by the castle the next evening at 8, so we stop off at Ratans to confirm this and make sure that he’s not confused when Arabella mentions the flowers. Ozdos also gets a healers kit at the market.

We sit and make a plan to deal with the church of the ascended while Ozdos attunes to the weapon of warning. We decide to send Ozdos, Moryx and Adalene as an infiltration team while Sirrush and Pyre wait/follow in the cart. First Disciple Mankaya (the lady from the church of the ascended with the magic powers we saw at the tavern) is there and says that we must leave our weapons and armour behind. Moryx is able to successfully conceal his flail form, and puts his chain shirt beneath his clothes to conceal it too. Ozdos has transformed the shapeshifting weapon of warning into a spoon to bring it with him, and he buys an “armour lumberjack shirt” off of Jizrek, which is allegedly as strong as chainmail, though we struggle to validate that claim (much to Ozdos’ injury), and Ozdos’ also feels the shirt clinging to him as though it were a part of him. He ends up paying 500 gold (300 from Sirrush and 200 from Adalene) to remove the curse, meaning he now has a shirt as strong as chainmail and without the stealth disadvantages.

With that mess handled, we set off in the church of the ascended’s cart, with the others following at the edge of visual range. Ozdos hangs his tail over the edge of the cart, holding the spoon with it and leaving a trail in the dirt, whisking it up whenever a guard comes near.

Ozdos speaks with some of the people in the cart, in particular some that look like they’re here due to a lack of options - after a disastrous performance playing the spoons, the conversation turns to the church - but no-one in the cart knows any friends or relatives who joined the church before them. After staging a bathroom break to let the others catch up after turning off of the main road, and Pyre and Sirrush making acquaintance with the guards and arranging for us all to camp together, both carts stop for the night at the roadside.

Mankaya tells Pyre and Sirrush about the church, attempting to magically indoctrinate them. Pyre resists but Sirrush does not.

The next morning, Sirrush wakes up first and attempts to join the church of the ascended after talking to Mankaya, who again strengthens the magic indoctrination. Pyre tries to leave in the cart, sticking to the original plan, which prompts Sirrush to run after him and leave his stuff with Pyre, but Pyre is able to break the charm (NAT 20!) and Sirrush decides to go with Pyre.
Sirrush again uses the circlet, and turns into an attractive (let’s hope that means adorable/cute in this case) 3-year old girl with black (as in a black person, not a drow) skin, medium length red hair, a soft voice, and grey eyes. Pyre swaddles Sirrush and the plan is to say that “Sirrusha” is Pyre’s adoptive daughter.

Pamykos regains control as the others awaken back at camp, but thankfully Moryx hadn’t said anything to them, so Pamykos being back shouldn’t disrupt things. Pyre rides the cart on to the next fork before stopping to wait and let the others catch up, under the guise of letting “the old man” rest in the back from travel sickness. Mankaya gives rough directions to the temple in case Pyre decides they want to see it, before taking the church’s passengers on down the road to the sound of Ozdos on the spoons and Pamykos on the flute.

Before long, we reach the temple, which looks well-looked after and luxurious. Mankaya introduces us to disciple Taranor who will give us a tour and show us to our rooms. We manage to convince a guard to let us outside for a few moments before they start testing our worthiness, and we use that time to let Sirrush and Pyre know where they’re keeping us, to look for a quiet way in, and to watch for any signals from us. With that, the tests begin.
These include offensive spellcasting, healing, medical knowledge, nature knowledge, athletics, and combat. Ozdos wins the combat test, but Adalene comes out on top overall, just barely. Pamykos is evaluated as basically ok and suggested for the church’s recruitment purposes, but Adalene and Ozdos have impressed the church, and it seems likely that they might join a ritual and ascend soon, possibly even by the end of the night.

Session 18
After the tests are complete, we are given 2 hours before the ritual. As Sirrush and Pyre watch from the trees, Ozdos devises a plan to acquire the infiltration team’s weapons. He tears some of the bedsheets up to make rope, and then lowers a bucket down through the latrine for Pyre and Sirrush to put things in.

Sirrush is distracted by a bird, but Pyre notices and they load two of Sirrush’s acid flasks, Ozdos’ sword, Adalene’s bow, and Pamykos’ shield (which is small enough to fit) up into (or tied onto) the bucket, which Ozdos pulls back up. The sword goes under Ozdos’ mattress, the shield and bow go under Pamykos’ and Adalene’s mattresses respectively, and Pamykos and Adalene each pocket one acid flask.

Pyre then throws baby Sirrush onto the wall and she ambushes a guard. The guard survives the initial acid barrage, but after a brief scuffle, Sirrush knocks him out, and Pyre changes appearance to match the guard after tying the unconscious guard up in the back of the cart.

Pyre gets Sirrush to the rest of the party, and Sirrush hides wrapped in robes under one of the beds, while Pyre patrols and the others try to gather more information including how long the ritual will take and what it will entail.

Pyre gets caught out by a changing of the guard and tries to figure out where to go next before his disguise expires, accidentally intruding on the halls of the main disciples, but is able to apologise and back out. He then stumbles in on Taranor, who questions why he’s not at his post - it transpires that Pyre was meant to move to a new post after being stood down, but Pyre is able to do this without further trouble.

The others then find Taranor (having witnessed some of the events with Pyre) and ask him what the ritual entails. Taranor explains that the praises of the ascended one will be spoken, the chosen will be brought before him to ask for power, and those who are not chosen shall bear witness and play a part, and be acknowledged by the ascended one. The ceremony takes perhaps an hour.

The others update Pyre (who has recast alter self to continue looking like a guard) and Sirrush on this, and Pyre gives Pamykos the bag of holding to stash the gear in from the dorms. Pamykos smuggles the bag of holding and Sirrush under his robes as the ritual begins and everyone gathers. 

As Pyre and the guards watch, Ozdos and Adalene sit in the front row, Pamykos behind them, and Taranor and Mankaya begin their sermon. Once the speaking part is done, Taranor pulls out a chalice inviting Ozdos and Adalene to drink from it. It is clear that drinking from it will impair them somehow. Ozdos is able to fake drinking from the chalice, but Adalene is unable to do so, instead looking hesitant, and Taranor is able to coerce her to drink, and she starts feeling slower, but nothing obvious.

Ozdos, Adalene and Pamykos are then called forth to a raising platform leading to where the white rose is. Mankaya, Taranor and two guards, including Pyre, escort them. Once across, the flower begins opening up, and Taranor gestures for us to step onto a platform inside it, which is clearly magical. We all step on and it takes us down into a carved out tunnel, the walls of which look unusual and alien. Behind a door at the bottom of the lift is a dimly lit chamber.

The architecture matches no commonly accepted species part of civilisation. As we started down the halls, the church members attempted to grab us, with a guard grabbing Adalene, and Pyre mock grappling Ozdos. The rest of us evade thanks to Ozdos’ spoon of warning, but the cultists, saying no more, try to grab us again when Pamykos questions them. However, Sirrush chooses this moment to remove the circlet, bursting forth from under Pamykos as a full-size naked dragonborn. This sends Pamykos tumbling over and prevents Mankaya grabbing him.

Pyre sneakily hands the greatsword he’s carrying to Ozdos and casts mage armour, which is not sneaky at all, but does power up his next spell due to wild magic. Sirrush steps over Pamykos and attacks Mankaya, and the fight begins.

Session 19

Eating cheese is a bonus action
Shit happened
We almost died
Pamykos went down multiple times as did Ozdos
Reminder: We gained a "Aang quarter staff of lightness" - it's in the bag of holding

Gary’s loose summary of this session from how it was explained to them - Blocked the lift from coming back down with the immovable rod, then charged round a corner and met a Mind Witness, which nearly killed everyone before being brought down. Before we could heal, the spoon of warning revealed a second mind witness coming around the corner.

Session 20
Ambushed and killed the second Mind Witness with spells and ranged attacks to trap it in Hunger of Hadar - 1500XP total for the two Witnesses
However, the big doors begin to open as the Mind Witness guardians no longer hold them shut.
Behind the doors is an Ulitharid (Superior Mind Flayer) which wants to control us, and we kill it after a big fight (2500 xp Level up!)
We then destroyed all the tadpole things that flay people after looting the bodies.
Session 21

Went back upstairs, everyone is free of the Ulitharid’s control now, people are sad, scared, running away. We decide to loot. Solve a puzzle at the altar to get a circlet of blasting, nothing of interest in Mankaya’s office besides written (in deep speech) orders from the “ascended one” to get more subjects. Got some holy scrolls of Chauntea from Taranor’s office (this place used to be a temple of Chauntea). Were hit by a psychic trap going into Mankaya’s quarters, but find a chest with an unknown potion and 500 gold.

Pyre renders the central lift inoperable (+500XP each including the altar puzzle) so we can leave this place in safer hands. We search the rest of the building and find 90 gold + a Potion of Sanctuary and a Potion of Bull’s Strength.

We find a few of the guards (now free from control of course) who look like they were capable of handling things before, and tell them to safeguard the temple and the people while we go back to Verbobonc to get some more official help. There’s a lot of impassioned speeches and such. And so we leave.

After camping (Moryx is back) and helping a lost old man, we continue on to the Kron hills to finish business in the region before returning to Verbobonc. There are tracks into a mine, but no signs of life outside, even in the shacks outside the mine, which look to have been abandoned for a few days. There’s a cart outside loaded up with an ore shipment, but why hasn’t it gone to Verbobonc? Some of the tracks outside the mines are unusual - animal tracks, not monstrous, but why so many animal tracks. No signs of magic were detected. The ore shipment looks to be normal, mostly iron. Moryx detects a slight natural magical energy from some of the other ores in the cart.

Peering into the dark with Devil’s Sight, Moryx can see messy bodies lying a short distance from the mine entrance. Stepping inside, the bodies appear to have been eviscerated by animals 2 days ago, and some supplies a short distance from the bodies contain 2 wheels of Miner’s Delight Cheese! There are the faint sounds of distant mining, and Sirrush can detect faint traces of death magic on the bodies. Looking around one corner reveals a side chamber three goblins, sleeping in beds made for humans, and looking around another reveals three human miners, but something is wrong with them, working on the walls. Moryx moves to barricade the goblins in their chamber from the other side, but while he does this he is seen by one of the undead. The goblins are roused by the sound of the battle beginning, but Ozdos and Adalene wait by the door (blessed and aided along with Pyre), darkness is cast by ozdos in the goblins room.

Combat paused on Adalene’s turn (turn order on Gary’s + Giorgia’s phone), see above for battle conditions, see roll20 for map.

In shackles not far from where Ayana was standing is Ayana's brother and 2 other druid prisoners.

"Oh Ayana, I never thought I would see you again! But why is it you stand with our enemies?" 

Ayana looks to him and lays her hands on his shoulders and says "we both know this has to end, I work with them to ensure our future, and the future of the natural world. There is no time to explain, just trust me!"

He looks to be lost in some internal battle for a moment before coming to his senses and a look of panic replaces the confusion that was there only moments ago. "Please, there is no time, Mother Ayella has lost her mind, you must retreat back into the city, it is not safe here! She has made a deal with… "

And before he can complete the sentence, a mighty shriek rips through the air and you hear the beating of great wings. As you gaze in horror towards the source of the sound, you see the the silhouette of a great winged beast that momentarily blocks out the sun, and atop its back a solitary rider, who you can only assume must be Mother Ayella.

The dragon glides overhead towards the city and lets out a volley of metallic, razor sharp looking shards into its midst. You hear screams and the sound of splintering wood and stone in the distance and can only imagine what might be happening. 

One of the guards look towards you with terror in his eyes and exclaims "we must go back and help them!"

Ayana looks to you and says "I stand with you!"
The others stand proud and say "and we are with Ayana"

Reward:
Wand of Farstriking
Triple a spell distance
3 charges. 
Disintegrates when out of charges

As you move towards the city, you hear more carnage and explosions. Stone and pieces of timber rain upwards in an arc as the dragon disappears in and out of the city. The sounds of magical explosions in the distance echo throughout the area. As you re-enter the city, you see Karthanor and defenders on the wall attempting to stop the dragon. 

The dragon bursts through one of the walls, destroying the top half along with the defenders and ballistas.

The other side of the wall is scattered with the dragons shards and the guards are dead. Karthanor looks heavily injured and shouts "mount the ballista, we must bring it down! There should be nets, then we will be able to fight it from ground level!"

From atop the wall you see magical energies exploding around the other side of the city along with the destruction the dragon has caused. Several buildings lie in complete ruin, bodies are strewn everywhere, and to your horror... the bridgewalk tavern is among those reduced to rubble.

Dragon then proceeds to destroy a part of the city.

On success

The great beast tumbles out of the sky, crashing into nearby buildings and reducing them to rubble. Karthanor continues to cast as it climbs to its feet and releases a frigid globe of ice energy at it. As it shakes off the blow, wings still entangled, it locks on to karthanor, crushing soldiers and civilians into the ground as it charges towards him. Before he manages to utter the last few syllables of his spell, the dragon reaches him and slashes with his razor sharp claws, spilling his guts and cutting his words short. As the surrounding guards and citizens watch on in shock, the dragon rises up above him, picks Karthenor up in its mouth and vigorously shakes its head back and forth in a horrifying display of savagery, as karthanors legs and head detach from his body in a spray of blood and gore.

The dragon turns its massive body, now facing the group as your new druid companions run to you, ready to lend their aid.

It lowers its head slightly to give way to the form of an elegant but fierce looking elf, dressed in a stylish but natural attire befitting that of a druid queen. 

So, you would turn against your own kind Ayana? So disappointing. Still, I can't say I am surprised after your brothers betrayal! It seems I have been far too lenient on you. Nevermind, I shall not make the same mistake again. I will save you for last to make an example of.

And before Ayana has a chance to respond, a burst of electric energy leaps forth from Ayellas staff, and a sphere of magical energy encloses ayella. She attempts speak and move forward but is knocked back by the swirling ball of energy that holds her, and not a sound is heard from the outside. As you turn back to the ayella and the dragon, it rises back up, obscuring your view of her and lets of an ear piercing roar as it readies for battle.

Players can take up to 4d8 (+4 per heal) healing per round at the start of their turns from druids
Dragon breath takes out 2 druids. Brother remains giving 2d8 +4 per round
2nd dragon breath or direct attack kills brother

On the final blow of the dragon, old bum jumps in front of its final attack taking a fatal hit, Ayella is thrown clear and the sphere around ayana breaks. If brother is dead, ayana goes to him, anger and tears brimming in her eyes.

"You dare, insect!?" she begins to exclaim as energy crackles from her fingertips and she stands and strides towards you all.

Before she has the chance to finish her spell, ayella cries "Enough Ayana! I invoke Han-Turaan for leadership of the Legion!", and the energy fades away as ayana begins to laugh.

"You invoke Han-Turaan!?" she laughs. Very well, this is as good a way as any to set an example of you. She turns to the group and says "I will call off the attack temporarily to honor the ceremony and be rid of you before i continue the decimation of this pitiful city. We shall create the ritual circle just outside of these city gates. Interference from anyone will result in an immediate end to the ritual and execution of the challenger. Do you Ayella of the Crescent Moon, daughter of Camira submit to these terms?

I do, replies Ayella with resolute determination in her eyes.

She turns to the group and asks "are these terms agreeable to you?"

She turns back to ayella and says
"Representatives of your new clan may be present to spectate your failure. They shall not be harmed until the ritual is complete and they have left the hallowed ritual grounds"

She clasps a horn attached around her neck and blows, releasing a deep and powerful tone. The sound of fighting ceases and Verboboncs forces begin to retreat back to within the safety of the city limits

Very well then, we meet at dawn tomorrow, and she turns to leave.

Ritual

3 elderly druids dressed in colourful garments stand near the centre of a large circle made up of druids.
Ayella and ayana enter the circle and kneel before them.
The first says "I Torbin, eyes of the three bear witness to the sacred challenge of Han-Turaan".
The second continues, "I Yara, wisdom of the three bear witness to the sacred challenge of the Han-Turaan". The final druid steps forward and finishes "I Wartan, ears of the three…. Etc".

The 3 step back into the perimeter of the circle and ayella and ayana move into position, waiting in anticipation. The 3 raise their staves into the air and as one shout "Let the Han-Turaan commence!" while slamming their staves into the ground.
The druids around the circle begin to chant Han-Turaan and tighten the circle, hammering their staves into the ground in time with the chant, and in an instant ayella morphs into a great tiger and ayana into a vicious looking tusked boar, and they charge at each other. 
Exchange viscous blows, taking slashes and puncture wounds from tusks, teeth and claws. They begin to slow as their animal forms tire and weaken. 
Turn back to humanoid form but too strong, slams her down into ground repeatedly.
When too weak to rise again, "blah blah".
Back turned, rises into the air, eyes turning green, hair flowing out and skin glowing radiant energy.
"Ayella, leader of the Crescent Moon, with the divine energy of the Earthmother, keeper of the wild, I reclaim that which has been given freely yet abused. You have lost your way and let vengeance guide you, against the creatures of this land and your once peaceful nature. You have lost yourself to the darkness and if left to your ways would bring ruin to your people and to that which you claim to protect. I absolve you of any further responsibility and cast you out. Perhaps in time you may regain my favour and serve me once again. Go now in peace."

Ayana puts 1 hand out and a stream of green and yellow energy pours out of ayellas skin and into ayanas hand, causing her ethereal glow to pulsate in waves.

A look of bewildered puzzlement crosses ayellas features and where once stood a radiant and confident figure now sat a husk of a woman covered in blood and dirt. The look of confusion gradually becomes replaced by anger, and she scrambles to her feet with arms out in front as if to utter a spell but nothing happens.
A momentary flash of confusion once again embellishes her features before rage boils out and she launches herself at ayana.

Time seems to slow down for a moment and at the split second before making contact, ayanas hand shoots up in a smooth but impossibly fast motion, one finger outstretched, and as ayana moves the last few inches before making contact, her eyes widen with recognition and regret. As the finger makes contact with her forehead, she closes her eyes in surrender and dissolves into a swirling fibbonachi pattern of energy that continues to spiral outwards past the unwavering form of ayana and into the air, reforming itself as it travels into ever changing images of nature.

The druids standing witness to the glowing avatar of their goddess fall to their knees in awe and submission, their heads bowed.

Ayana turns to you, and you feel an overwhelming presence of power and love in one.

She begins to speak "and to you, the brave souls who offer mercy where others may take advantage, and offer aid where many would take the easy path, I offer you a boon, an exhange of energy from that which has been returned to the source if you will.

A sudden flash of blinding yellow light flashes out from ayanas outstretched hand followed by an overwhelming sensation of pleasure, briefly painful in its all encompassing intensity. As suddenly as it appeared, it disappeared.

"It is done, and before I depart I offer a word of warning. For reasons that are far too complex for you to comprehend i may not interfere any more than i already have, lest i upset the balance of the realms. The path you follow leads you into terrible danger. The one you chase called Fazrahl seeks to recover a weapon powerful enough to kill a god and he must be stopped from doing so. The first part of three lies hidden in the depths of a realm where darkness rules and sunlight never touches. Be not afraid to embrace all that comes to pass and trust within each other, for you can only succeed undivided."

Ayana lowers back down to the ground, and although the flowing graceful energy had left her body, she still seems imbued with an overabundance of vitality.

The three druids step forward, staffs raised and cry "all hail ayana, daughter of *****, leader of the clans and mother to the Legion. All of the Druids follow suit and slam their staves to the floor in unison.

Ayana raises her own staff into the air and says "now let us put an end to this suffering, regains our footing and return to the path that we were born to walk upon. Yet let us not forget the sacrifices we have made and the reason we lost our way to begin with!"

Ayana turns to you and continues "brave souls of faerun, wanderers of justice, you shall forever have our ears and be welcome in our lands. I now implore you one more task, to help broker a peace between the druid Legion of the Crescent Moon and the council of faerun. Will you accept this responsibility?

Ratan says "as a leader of one of the principle cities of faerun, and that which has been at the forefront of this conflict, any deal that is striken between us and the druid legion shall stand, i pledge my honor upon it and swear to it."

Very well, i understand that this era of growth and technology places more demand upon the land, but if we plunder the land and take more than she can provide, it will cause the downfall of us all.

I agree says Ratan, what do you suggest? the terms for the cessation

Druids
Reimbursement for dead animals and forests in terms of produce and gold
Stop cutting forests down
Stop overfarming the land

Faerun
Reimbursement for death, damage to city and interruption to trade
Druids to return to snakewood forest and sign a peace treaty

Anger from both sides.
Ayana says ayellas methods and insults against nature were an abomination, but that she has no problem continuing to fight for the natural order to be returned, in line with nature.

Destroyed buildings
South wall
Bridgewalk tavern

Power point north east of athkatla

—----------------

A whole lot of time passes, the chronicles of which have been lost to the ages (RIP original google drive notes)

23/3/23
We start out making our final preparations for Lord Bumberton's ball. Pamykos changes into his finery over his chainshirt, now matching the expectations for a fancy bard.
Pyre fails to adequately mask Okurak's Half-orcishness or Sirrush's dragonbornity with his disguise kit, so Sirrush uses the circlet of human appearance to turn into a 21-year old woman with olive skin, very long red hair, a deep voice, green eyes, a height of four feet, and 16.8 kg of weight. We weren't expecting a tiny, extremely thin woman, but it'll have to do.
Okurak buys a disguise potion that should last 8 hours. He promptly drinks it and produces an illusion of a fairly normal-looking human with the occasional orcish facial feature.
Gideon buys tearaway clothes from a very creepy man to make it easier to begin his hamboning routine.
Pyre goes to find Tobin the wizard, who is of course high as heck, to see if he can offer some magic weed that can disguise him, but it seems not. In the end, he decides to get another potion like Okurak's since Alter Self wouldn't last the full event. With that all sorted out, we make for the ball in time for the event!
We meet the head servant at the gate, who seems as stressed and paranoid as ever. He's frustrated at how unpresentable Sirrush is, but nonetheless gives use all a mask for the ball and leads us all inside to get set up.
Sadly, Pyre's wand of far striking and Aang's quarterstaff of lightness were confiscated by the guards, to be kept at the entrance for when we leave. We're led into the main ballroom and subsequently shown around the house. The library is out of bounds and the guests begin to arrive. The catering members of our team are told to prepare food in the main food room and to rove the party to offer it to guests. The musicians of the team are directed to play on the stage in the main ballroom. Lastly, we're pointed toward a room at the north of the house where an orgy may be happening, where the participants may request food. If we perform well enough we'll be allowed to join the festivities when we're done.
There's also a particularly tough looking guard defending some double doors to the west.
As the festivities kick off, we begin working on our roles at the party. Sirrush caters in the food hall, Pyre in the halls and ballroom, and Okurak in the orgy room, seeing things he can't unsee and hearing things he can't unhear. Gideon and Pamykos play music in the ballroom, Gideon's performance being especially captivating.
The catering crew notice a man talking with the big guard, and a covered up cart being wheeled past.
Overall our conduct is deemed sufficient for us to stay at the party, but he was disappointed in Gideon and Sirrush and so they are not allowed to dine.
The food seems mostly normal but there's a magic dish called Pomeranian Fig which makes the eater very flushed. There's much fancy wine and beverages, along with a magic spirit called Toucan's Treasure, which is one drink per guest. Pyre lines his pockets with the figs and manages to take a bottle of high-class elderwine.
- Food of note:
Pomeranian fig - fig that causes the consumer to become more talkative and relaxed. Causes red flushing of the face.
Okurak and Pamykos toast over the Toucan's Treasure. Okurak coughs up a godstone gem that forms in his mouth, only to try and swallow it back thinking it's something that's supposed to remain inside! Pamykos coughs up a bottle of dark liquid, leaking smoke from the lead stopper, which he recognises as an ever-smoking bottle.
Pyre, seeing this, also imbibes, and subsequently a scroll for Circle of Death at Lv6 emerges from his throat.
Sirrush goes and sits next to one of the many guests, who seems oddly drawn to Sirrush's current form. Sirrush introduces themselves as Clarissa, and the lord as Lord Jathryn(?). He finds the party's events adequate, but nothing special. Clarissa asks if there's anything special happening that isn't advertised at this party, and the Lord expresses that Bumbleton is a dangerous, ruthless man, so he stays out of the way and on his good side. However, Jathryn does mention the door with the heavy guard, which supposedly leads to the cellar. Jathryn mostly just sits and drinks in the food hall at these parties since his wife died. Regarding the disappearances, he says he's noticed some rumours and some changes, but can't confirm anything. "Clarissa" bids him farewell and moves to talk with Pyre.
Pamykos makes an effort to talk with lord Bumbleton himself, but he's not very welcoming and soon returns to talking with his friends. Okurak eavesdrops and catches the Lord suggesting that the lower classes should be removed from the city, and how much better that would make things. Next, a crazy plan is hatched to try and replace the guard at the cellar door in which Sirrush seduces him while Pamykos distracts the other guard in that hall.
It nearly works, with the guard clearly interested, but he commits to doing his job and remaining at his post. Gideon almost convinces him to leave his post to join him with a lady in the orgy room, but he, while disappointed, remains resolute. He starts to get irritated by Sirrush' insistence, so we have to back off.


30/3/23
Our next plan involves Sirrush's potion of gaseous form and Pamykos' new eversmoking bottle. This is risky, but something fortuitous happens! One of the guests in the foodhall kicks off and lets some magic loose, resulting in a guard from that room summoning the big buff guard who was protecting the cellar stairs, replacing him with a much weaker individual who should be easier to deal with. Okurak suggests inciting the new guard with greed and getting him to chase after some gems, allowing us to pass by into the library, then using his stone shape spell to pass through the exterior wall of the cellar stairwell.
The plan goes off without a hitch, and we proceed outside after collecting some interesting books and spell scrolls from the library. Okurak makes a door in the cellar stairwell, which we pass through and head downstairs. The cellar has some weapons for a couple of us to make use of, as well as a waiting area for guards with some more supplies. It's cold, damp and uncomfortable. We find some chainmail for Gideon, and thankfully no-one comes downstairs to check on us, so the guard mustn't have realised what happened to him.
There's also a doorway to a very unpleasant dungeon corridor, with the decayed remains of several long-forgotten prisoners trapped in cells. Down the end of the corridor, which is very dark and creepy, there's a door which feels important. Inside we find a large square pit with lava below it, and a large orb in the centre, with stairs leading to it. The magma and orb are emitting light. There are four suits of armour with an inscription on them, which Pamykos reads to be a statement about balancing energy through opposing elements. There don't appear to be traps in the room, though more words surround the orb, telling of ancient arcane links between locations, along with depictions of towers, and the orb crackles with energy.
Pyre touches the orb, unleashing ripples of energy. The crackling increases with a low hum, and bursts of energy begin to spring forth from the orb and into the suits of armour. We all begin to levitate into the air as the suit springs into life, emitting waves of dark energy. The door seals and battle begins. We soon learn that hitting the statues with the opposing element to that which they emit cancels out those effects, causing the orb to emit a new elemental arc that we need to cancel out. We cycle the statues through dark, fire, cold. and psychic powered statues, answering them with radiant, cold, fire, and force, we defeat the stone's defenses and a portal opens up. The levitation field ends and we all drop to the floor. A Modron summoned by Pyre's wild magic surge falls in the lava and dies before returning to it's plane.
We approach the orb and take the portal. We find ourselves in a circular ritual room with two orcs who, thinking we were cult members in disguise, nonchanlantly gesture for us to leave our disguises in a wardrobe, talk about lord Fazrahl's plans to recover a weapon of some kind, stating that he's close to finding the other pieces he needs, and then realise that they weren't supposed to have more company arrive yet, and that we're supposed to be in the mountains by now. Pamykos tries and fails to convince them that the party represent the supervillains union of Faerun before killing one of them, starting another battle. Okurak and Pyre fell the other orc, Gideon and Okurak taking their greataxes.
Room with 2 guards and masquerade costumes.
Guards there don't react, gesture to place to leave ball masks.
"So yeah, wot wuz i sayin?"
"About the weapon"
"Oh yeh, I heards that Lord Fazrahls getting closer to finding where the other bits n bobs he needs are. Dunno what he needs em for but the quicker he gets em, the quicker we'll be in charge of these haunts. Yeah, i'm really lookin forward to strikin a bit o fear into the hearts of some of the wankers that live round ere, ho hooh!" as he rubs his hands together."
Then the other one nudges him and says "Hang on a minute, were we expectin more company? Oi, wots goin on? Aren't you lot supposed ta be in the mountains?"
Looking around, this appears to be the room that powers the portal, and we surmise that we're in a tower of some kind. We don't see a way to turn off the portal, and we worry it could be catastrophic to interfere with the magics at work. However, it appears we should be able to get back the way we came. There's a large staircase heading upwards. There don't appear to be any traps, but the moment Pamykos goes to sneak upstairs, some kind of ugly pixie appears and asks us a riddle. We presumably get it wrong, since she blows pixie dust over us that makes Pyre and Sirrush itch maly for a minute.
The next room above is clear, so Pamykos summons the others. The room appears to be some kind of alchemical workshop. Sirrush finds a book of potions that they take interest in and keep for later. The room is also full of various alchemical equipment and ingredients, including psychedelic mushrooms that may send the eater into a rage, and a couple of potions vats, one with a healing potion, and another that will cause erupting boils on contact. Pamykos collects two healing potions worth from the amount remaining.
As we explore, the room gets colder and a sad, lost ghost appears. It reaches for Pyre, who touches it and forms a telepathic connection with him. The ghost is an outcast from a telepathic race who wasn't given the proper passing rituals. We agree to help with the ritual to send it onwards, which requires a little of our blood. The ghost is grateful, and grants us a small boon of health as he moves on.
We move to proceed upstairs and the pixie asks us another riddle. We're wrong again, and another cloud of dust is blown our way, making Pamykos very depressed. The next floor is clearly a library, with three orcs training. Upon seeing us, they declare a practical test of what we've learned and charge us, turning invisible. Pamykos reveals them with Faerie fire and the fight begins proper.

4/4/23
We defeat the orcs in the library room, recovering a poison oil for a weapon. Searching the place, we find a book of Arcane Secrets - A generous manuscript contains description of inner workings of various contraptions and automatons and instruction manual to programing automatons, allowing any intermediate transmuter to create their very own contraptions! - and a story book called the unaligned monk. Pyre takes the book of Arcane Secrets, and Pamykos keeps the story book.
This time, Gideon moves to proceed upstairs, again encountering the goblin-fairy thing with another riddle. Again we have no good answer, and she blows more dust, causing Pyre and Pamykos to dance uncontrollably. We continue up, emerging at the top of the spiral stairs in a room with a door and a cattleprod-like staff which Pyre takes. Heading through we find ourselves in a prison corridor in which we can hear whimpering. The cells all hold roughed-up looking people in the dirty remains of ornate clothes. We recognise one lady from her description as Potraya, one of the kidnap victims! We explain who we are to her, but she warns us of a "beast" and we are attacked by a giant pig monster!
After dispatching this beast, some prisoners emerge from the cell and meekly see what's going on. Some of them attack the beast's corpse. They tell us this floor is clear for now, but the top of the tower still hosts "The Dark One" at the top of the tower, who rarely comes down here. This person was once one of the rich people of Athkatla before being recruited by "one darker still" (Lord Fazrahl?) who said that this dark one spoke to him. We decide to wait and rest in one of the cells before proceeding upwards.
During the rest, Gideon milks the pig beast corpse for cheese, and we talk to the prisoners. They're all the high ranking people from Athkatla's government, taken from the city by the cult. Apparently, they were brought here to be kept out of the way when issues arose with the Celestine Dawn's plan when we interfered in the sewers. Manbridge, who was the first to be taken of the people here, is now a deceased pile of sludge. The prisoners here have seen Lord Fazrahl himself pass through, but he was cloaked and too scary to look at, so they have no description to give us. We warn them of their doppelgangers back home, tell them to head back through the portal below and make a break for it through the cellar stairwell wall, which they do.
We prepare to head upstairs to confront the dark one, and finally give an answer that the fairy thing is happy with on the last set of stairs - she heals us and boosts our health for a bit, also recharging our spells.
Heading up, we find ourselves in a large-ish passageway. We can hear a low hum. Sneaking through and checking door by door, we don't find much of interest besides some plans for city construction and a book called "What those guts told me" - Not only does this book go in-depth on the history of these creatures and their faraway worlds, it also tells that they are really into gardening and the various flowers, vegetables and fruits they have cultivated. in a bedroom-office sort of room, and an Onyx gem, which Okurak takes. Through the door at the end of the room we enter into a massive chamber, the low hum pulsing through the room. In the centre upon a dais hovers a figure with a missing hand replaced by dark energy, his body covered in putrid veins. It's Brother Morgenson, who after issuing us with a greeting fit for the order of Helm, turns to meet us with glowing eyes of a changed colour. After being exiled from the order and the city, he must have joined Fazrahl's cult. He says he's pleased at the prospect of delivering us as powerful subjects for Fazrahl's next ritual.

13/3/23

The Battle against Brother Morgenson rages! He's protected by a fluctuating shield he controls which makes him immune/resistant to different damage types at given times. We each get some major hits in as he primarily focuses his attacks on Gideon.
As he nears death, he latches on to several of us with fleshy shadow tentacles that begin to sap our life force to restore his. Okurak unleashes a full power thunder wave which puts him down.

27/4/23

As Morgenson's body collapses, his shadow hand fizzles away, revealing a diamond-like gemstone that drops to the floor, prismatic and brilliant, in place of the demonic energy that flowed through him. Pamykos and Pyre determine it to be Arcanite, formely demonic arcanite, infused with a demonic being's energy, but that enchantment was fuelled by morgenson's life force and has dissipated.
Arcanite is incredibly rare. While it doesn't do much on its own, it has great potential and can absorb energies from various sources to take on new properties. Pamykos pockets it for later use. Morgenson also drops a magic sword and armour that Pamykos is unable to identify. He also finds an interesting stone on a nearby table, which pamykos recognises as a portal attunement stone, which would have protected us from the armour suits on the far side of the portal. The stone is reacting to energies here, suggesting there's a portal here too.
Gideon takes the sword, and Okurak the armour (which makes him feel more resilient.). Pamykos checks the other door and finds a bedroom/office with a desk. The drawers of the desk are suspicious with a magical trap (he calls Pyre to disarm), and there's a note on the desk. The note is Morgenson's journal telling us of his fate since his exile from Verbobonc. There are also notes on power and portal attunement signed by Akuji, another of Fazrahl's lieutenants. They reveal that the top floor's portal leads to a secret crypt under bigwig hill in Athkatla, and refers to a second, twinned tower, which may refer to the twin towers north of Athkatla. Okurak tries to shape a window into the tower stone, but a strong sealing magic resists him. Okurak dispels the magic on the desk drawers and Pyre disarms a mechanical trap, giving us plenty of goodies from the drawer, including some gems, potions, and some more pixie fire.
We opt to go through the second portal to the bigwig hill crypt, and make our way back to report in. As expected, we find ourselves in a damp crypt behind an iron gate. Two guards see that we aren't Fazrahl and try to book it. One gets away, but we take the other alive and interrogate him under a zone of truth. He reveals that they'll be running for the encampment in the Cloud Peaks mountains north of Athkatla. He gives us instructions to find the encampment, which Pamykos notes down. He tells us that none of the really important cultists are there, but all of the three orc clans (Dresden, Skullsplitter and Garskul?) are there united under the banner of the demon of the dale. He's from Dresden. He'd been guarding the tower for a few weeks, and people were coming in and out all the time. He last saw Fazrahl a couple of weeks ago. He's seem him a couple of times, and neither was pleasant. Last he heard Fazrahl was off searching for powerful relics while his forces here move to control the city.
When we're done interrogating him, we place Okurak's ring of tracking on him, and Pamykos modifies the orc's memories, removing the interrogation and making the orc think he escaped scott-free, finding a cool ring along the way. That way, he'll lead us straight to the other orcs and they won't know what we know. We make our way over to highgarden to check on Bumberton's Manor and see what became of the situation since we left, and also to figure out the retrieval of any of our confiscated belongings. Okurak stone shapes a sneaky way in through the side wall, and Pyre goes in with Okurak to retrieve his belongings from security.
It doesn't really work, with the two of them being caught and held for questioning by the guards until the party ends. Pyre picks the lock and they make a break for the hole in the wall instead, however, deciding that they won't miss the confiscated items. They creep around the compound's edge, rejoining the rest of us, and we head back to the inn since it's around midnight. We'll report in to Lorrus first thing tomorrow.
We awake the next day to the cleaning dwarf zooming around (including polishing Pamykos' forehead and horns). Pamykos is unable to make much progress with Reyk today, but Pyre deepens his Berrykin connection. He struggles with Hokoki's box however. Okurak pays the blacksmith a visit, paying another 1500g, paying him in full. His armour should be ready in 9 days. With that, we head off to see Lorrus.
As we enter the governor's chambers, he looks very concerned, and out of a dark corner of the room, a shadowy figure emerges. He's the local master of the Thieves' Guild, Fayzin(?), here for an audience. He tells us we shouldn't have rubbed that guy's legs to try and get an audience, and that the mayor has requested the thieves' guild's help. The master says it's all in hand now, with the thieves' guild set to maintain the balance of the city and we should leave while we still can. He suggests that we might not be so lucky if we keep tangling with Fazrahl's Cult. We ask Lorrus for his thoughts on this, and he, with nervous glances at Fayzin, suggests we present our information. Fayzin says the best way we can help is to give our info and stay out of the way.
Gideon senses evil from Fayzin, so we tell Lorrus we can't provide our intel with Fayzin determined to keep us out of the operation, so we bid him farewell for the time being and resolve to continue seeking answers ourselves.

11/5/23

Leaving the governor's building, we decide to head to the adventurer's guild and ask Eldric if there any final options for keeping the city safe while we deal with the orcs to the north. We ask him for a room to discuss matters that is warded from prying eyes, and we are ushered into the back. We offer a zone of truth to seal things in, but he doesn't appear to have anything to hide. Eldric doesn't think any individuals could really help. He says we could ask after one of the paladin guilds, but that they may be unwilling to step on the toes of local government. There are no local druids we can call on, as they dislike the city's workings.
We warn Eldric to keep an eye out and make sure he and some guild adventurers are prepared for danger, and decide we'll take things into our own hands after all. Eldric points us to somewhere we can buy or rent horses and carts, and off we set. Pyre is generous enough to buy those of us who don't already have a mount (so everyone except Gideon) a riding horse each saddlebags for 315 gold, and the stables agree to throw in some hay to feed them with. Pyre's horse is white and the rest are brown with black patches.
We clear out our rooms at the inn (for now), tell the time-traveller Elderon that we have half of the ingredients he needs to return to his time and give him our assurances we plan to return and help him. We decide to get those beholder anal glands from the beholder in the abandoned ruins on our way out North, to give to the market quartermaster on our return.
We reach the ruins around nightfall. We make camp, secure our horses and head into the lair. Entering the cave, we see a high ceiling that looks carved as if by some kind of magic. A strange aura permeates the air, and we see a pedestal with a shiny amulet upon it emitting power. A duck appears to walk out of the shadows, but it has spindly human legs and a full set of human teeth, looks eagerly at us and gestures for us to take the amulet. Pyre is drawn in and reaches for the amulet, only for the duck to frenzy and lunge for him.
After an unusual battle in which it confuses us with screams and lays eggs, spitting blood from its eyes…

18/5/23

After finally slaying the duck thing and its brood, we heal up, and Pamykos determines that the amulet is an amulet of health. While Gideon stands guard, the party benefits from Pamykos' catnap spell, but the beholder attacks as we are awakening.
Pamykos tries to take cover, but is grappled, targeted by the beholder, and beamed into magical sleep. Gideon is attacked trying to slip behind it, but remains resolute. Pyre calls his spirit dragon in. Okurak wakes Pamykos and summons his spiritual weapon. Unfortunately, the Beholder unleashes an anti-magic wave that suppresses almost all of us, de-summoning the dragon spirit and spiritual weapon. It also summons a wave of slime to block our access. Gideon is dodging beams like crazy while the rest of us try to advance. Pamykos breaks free and unleashes more eldritch blasts, but is put to sleep again! Gideon misty-steps onto the Beholder to attack, but is launched airborne by another beam!
The battle rages on in a ridiculous fashion, with Pamykos being charmed and running off with the anti-beholder popper, Gideon turning to stone, and the others all paralyzed, bar Pyre! Thankfully, Pyre is able to fly up and use the popper after getting it from Pamykos.

1/6/23

The Beholder is successfully paralysed, and we begin our efforts to find the anal glands and extract what we need. We figure it out, and Okurak plunges his hand in there. There's a mishap or two along the way, in which the Beholder's toothy anus clamps down on Okurak's arm, but we get the fluid we need, securing it in a vial, and bail the hell out, with Okurak carrying the petrified Gideon.
The next morning, Okurak de-petrifies Gideon, and we continue on toward the mountains. Additionally, Pyre solves one mechanism of Hokoki's box, and figures out that he needs some Tentonite and magical energy to open the box. Pyre also builds trust with his Berrykin, but Pamykos doesn't cover new ground with Reyk the Raven.
Along the way, we have to duck out of the way of a horse-race on the road, taking the time to rescue a young nobleman thrown from his horse (who rewards us with gold for our rescuing and healing services), who then recruits us to clear out some bugbears from the forest. He charges off and gets killed, but we defeat the bugbears with ease and Okurak revives the man, who rewards us with two diamonds (one of which replaces one used to revive him), which Okurak takes, as well as a bloodstone and an amethyst which go to Gideon. We proceed onward.
Another day begins. This time, Pamykos does bond further with Reyk, deepening the psychic connection, allowing for somewhat blurry psychic image transfer. Pyre doesn't get very far with his berrykin or box, though.
Next along the road, we encounter a huge troll guarding a bridge. The troll looks like he's high on something, and he's hefting a lawnmower! He speaks in broken common with a heavy accent, but Sirrush can understand thanks to his helm of comprehend languages. It seems his name is Muddy Muddingtons. We try to negotiate a crossing in exchange for help patching his bridge up, but he's not very trusting of magic. We decide to ride downstream and have Okurak shape the water to make us a river crossing. Later, Okurak decides we should ride back to the other side of the bridge to taunt/test the troll. Naturally, Muddy attacks us with his lawnmower.
We fight the troll for a bit, and once he's a bit bloodied up, he offers us surrender and a present to stop hitting him. He lets us take a magic shield from his junk pile, which Okurak does, and we move on, but not before Okurak fixes a few bits of his bridge and Pyre gives the troll some snuffweed, which can only end well. We've reached the base of the mountain, and begin heading up, meeting some weary travellers who want to sell us anything they have to escape poverty. Apparently the orcs attacked them from the west at their village, Ashtangar (which is East of the mountain pass), and took their homes, families, and more. We end up taking a map of the mountains, and Pyre and Pamykos each give the impoverished villagers 50 gold to ease their troubles. When we ask about any useful tricks, hidden routes, or similar, in the mountains, they tell us of a Black Dragonborn called Gorsh, a name Sirrush loosely recognises, who was once part of their village and may be of help to us (especially if we give him the name Tannis) and is probably somewhere on the path ahead. Apparently there were around 30 orcs in the party that attacked. They thank us and head away.
We have a short rest, and Pyre determines the troll's shield to be a shield of protection, (but not in a useful way, so far, which is to say that it receives protection from it's bearer.) As we carry on, we encounter an older black dragonborn, who greets us, especially Sirrush, and introduces himself as Gorsh. Apparently, he's lost both his original family and his new one in Ashtangar to those skullsplitter orcs, and he's tracked them this far to seek his revenge, but he's grown weary. It turns out that Gorsh and Sirrush are both from the same village, Ashartang, originally, with Gorsh having left the ruins of Ashartang and founded Ashtangar in memory elsewhere in the mountains.
Gorsh tells us about the orc encampment, and how it depends on very loose alliances. He explains that the leader of the skullsplitters, Grimgore the Butcher, is the one responsible for the massacres of Sirrush and Gorsh's home village, Gorsh's new home, and many more. The one warlord presiding over all of the three orc tribes present at the camp isn't present, but that could be to our advantage. If we can turn the orc tribes against eachother, we can sneak in to kill Grimgore. Grimgore also wields a dragonborn axe, looted from those he has persecuted, but only a dragonborn can unlock it's true power, and Gorsh suggests it would be better in Sirrush's hands.
Gorsh recommends to us a hidden pass in an area that the orcs deem impassable, and explains that they have a moment of vulnerability when they change guard under the cover of dark at night. Once Grimgore is dead, the orcs should fall to infighting and scatter to the wind. He wishes us the best, but decides he is too weary to join us in the battle. Sirrush gifts him the shrunken orc head he collected previously as a token of revenge, and vows to fight in his honor and to avenge their families and clan.
15/6/23
We tie up our horses and begin to make our way through this hidden pass Gorsh pointed us towards. It's fairly obscured and treacherous, so we tread lightly but stumble a bit along the way.
We encounter no guards, but Pyre gets winged by a trap. Okurak gets overheard by a guard as we creep toward the camp, who comes over to investigate. Okurak says he comes to join the camp, having heard about it. He asks what tribe Okurak is from, to which Okurak says he has no tribe. The guard is unconvinced and goes to run to camp, but Gideon catches him with Hold Person, and we kill him before he can break free. The guard was from the skullsplitter clan, and Okurak takes his cloak and signet, which looks like a bloodstained, double-bladed axe splitting a skull in half to blend in. We can clearly see the Skullsplitter command tent in the north of the camp, and there are two other clear areas for the other clans, along with a fighting pit in the middle. A huge orc, presumably Grimgore, presides over a brawl that ends in a castration-by-stomping that ends an inter-tribe conflict, and Grimgore sends everyone back to their posts.
Okurak, listening carefully, overhears some orcs grumbling about those "Dresden scumbags," threatening violence if one more thing happens, and also complaining that it was their leader, the Demon of the Dale (a name we've heard before) who brought the tribes together, but that "this Skullsplitter scum Grimgore thinks he can lord it over us" and "just wait until the demon of the dale gets here". Okurak recognises the symbols of the Garskull clan (who are the ones with the Demon of the Dale as their leader, known for their ferocity, and are based South East of the camp) as well as the Dresden clan (who are based in the West, and who ran into at the tower).
We plot to hide the dead Skullsplitter guards cloak in the Dresden camp, to frame them for the death. Pamykos takes the cloak from Okurak and sneaks it into place, half stuffing it into a pile of dirty clothes so it looks like it was clumsily hidden. He also uses a vial from Okurak to stain some other clothes in the pile with the dead orc's blood. Okurak drags the body into place near the treeline, but between the Dresden and Skullsplitter camp. We take cover and climb into trees, which Pyre struggles with, so Sirrush winches him up with rope. Pyre then casts Minor Illusion, replicating the sound of an orc crying out at some "Dresden murderers!" before crying out in pain.
Orcs come over to investigate, and conflict begins to grow. We leave our trees and head around the back of the Skullslitter side of the camp as more and more of them head over to the disturbance. We come out behind Grimgore's command tent, next to which sits an abused looking Mountain Lion that someone has tried to bend to their will. Sirrush tries and fails to communicate with it, but feeds it some meat from the campfire, which maybe helps. We all take pity on it, but Gideon enough so to try to break the lock even though the lion doesn't seem too keen on us as anything other than food. He breaks the lock and leaves the door ajar before we go to the command tent, giving it some space to leave the cage.
We move to creep in the back of the tent, and the lion bolts from the cage. We see, looking back where we were, and see that we're clear to enter the tent as the Skullsplitters keep arguing with the Dresden. We creep in the back as Grimgore orders a hulking lieutenant, Gronk the Raging Brute, to go and see what's happening. Also present is a more cunning, agile-looking orc - Hruk the Shadowblade.
Grimgore doesn't mince words, and battle begins. Some kind of magic security restrains Pyre, Sirrush and Okurak, but we retaliate with chromatic orbs from Pyre, longbow shots from Sirrush, Gideon charging into the fray with misty step, and Pamykos unleashing mind whips. The tent's security unleashes all kinds of magical effects, inflicting fear on some of us, rage on others, as brutal combat rages.
After a gruelling fight, Grimgore and Gronk fall, but Hruk (whose name we don't know, to clarify), disappears and runs away. Gideon picks up the fabled axe and tosses it to Sirrush. It practically leaps into Sirrush's hand, like this was meant to be. Sirrush can't recall much about it's history, only remembering seeing it as a baby when a fabled Dragonborn hero was in town. Pamykos discerns that it should grow in power as Sirrush connects with it.

27/7/23

Okurak takes Grimgore's head as a trophy and as proof of Grimgore's demise. The sound of the inter-tribe conflict continues outside, but not as loud as before. We search the command tent and find Grimgore's journal detailing him joining the "Demon of the Dale" (The main warlord who isn't in this camp at the moment). It also explains his frustrations at the tribes not obeying him, their plans to influence Athkatla when Fazrahl takes charge, and also their plans to raid the underdark in the near future!

The journal comes a map showing their orc warband's route to the underdark. We decide to leave the camp and find a place to rest, recover and plan our next moves, though we quickly pilfer the command tent before leaving, retrieving some fancy looking boots from Gronk, the brutish lieutenant.

Grimgor’s Journal
Entry 1 (Earlier):
"Grimgor join Demon of Dale, strong and fierce! Crush weak ones, show strength! Get Athkatla when Lord Fazrahl boss. Glory come!"

Entry 2 (A Few Weeks Later):
"Move to mountains, not even cold! Grimgor lead raids, take stuff on way, kill, happy. Soon raid underdark. Wait for Fazrahl's helper, get magic for."

Entry 3 (Another Few Weeks Later):
"Stupid clan cause trouble, not show respect for Grimgor. Grimgor angry, maybe smash soon. Demon join clans maybe not so good, maybe not good idea. Grimgor's axe hungry, but must wait..."

Entry 4 (Most Recent):
"Grimgor getting mad, not know what to do. Clan not listen, make Grimgor angry. No cold in dumb mountains, make grimgor soft! Grimgor not sure, maybe kill all soon, maybe not. Grimgor ready to smash!"
We sneak out of the back of the tent and Okurak suggests we light it on fire, so we do! All of the orcs are so busy fighting they don't seem to notice, and the tribes are busy killing each other or scattering into the wilds.
We head to retrieve our horses and carry on to the ruins of Gorsh's (the dragonborn from Sirrush's original village we met on the road) newer village. We give the remaining villagers the good news that we've broken the warband. They are grateful but wish we could have come sooner. They offer us some safe(ish) lodgings, which is around about all we need from them, since it's now night-time. We ask the villagers to wake us if danger comes, and try to settle in.
Sadly, our rest is interrupted by screaming villagers and orcish warcries. We arm ourselves quickly and head out to find some of the remaining orcs attacking! We quickly dispatch them (one with an Eldritch Blast from Pamykos, one with a Fire Bolt from Pyre, and the third, terrified and bludgeoned by Okurak's warhammer.) The camp falls quiet once again, and we rest without further incident.
The next morning, Pamykos deepens his connection with Reyk, Pyre grapples with Hokoki's box and connects a little more with his Berrykin. We debate our next moves, deciding to return and check in on Athkatla, looking for some Deathroot (?, the plant we need for a quest) in some of the peaks along the way.
We encounter an old woman in a cave on our way back. She says she's been expecting us, having heard of our route down into the shadowlands. She introduces herself as "Granny Flowers" (indicates she may be half-ent?) and wants us to retrieve a special seed from down in the underdark, and invites us for refreshments outside cave. She says she hears whispers from the wilderness and pours us tea, knowing about our defeat of the orc warband. She also seems to know about those we've lost along our journey, and suggests that if we retrieve the seed she wants from the Underdark, she can make an elixir that could revive old bum.
She demonstrates her abilities to make plants grow, but upon seeing a slug, she runs and grabs a shovel from her shed, mashing the slug before swinging it wildly around, no evidence of the old lady in her eyes, just wild rage. Most of us duck out of the way, but Okurak and Sirrush catch blows from the shovel! Okurak banishes her for one minute, and Pyre and Sirrush take the brief opportunity to snoop in her home, but can't find anything clearly useful to us amidst the mess.
She comes back, calm now, and apologises before elaborating. She wants a seed of Twilight Thistle, describing it for us and giving us a picture on some parchment. She also gives Pyre some guidance with his berrykin. She also says she's heard on the wind about our quest for some Deathroot, and marks us some peaks along our route where we can find some. She heals Sirrush and Okurak of their wounds and gives us some tea for the road.
As we near the peak where we can get some root, Pamykos recounts the properties of the plant. We need to carefully clamber up the mountains, and be careful to avoid the ensnaring roots, poisonous spores and deadly sap. Gideon volunteers to make the climb, with Pyre suggesting a route (not a good one though), and Gideon comes tumbling back down. After another failed attempt, Okurak takes an attempt and also fails, but Gideon finally spots a path with better handholds. Having made it up there, Gideon tries to grab the plant, having not paid attention to Pamykos' lessons. He avoids getting caught by the thorny vines, but still gets cut, and takes a facefull of spores for his trouble. Okurak and Gideon climb back down a little worse for ware, but we've got the Deathroot.
We keep riding, and rest once night falls. The next morning, Pyre scares his Berrykin (thankfully catching it before it gets away), struggles more with the mystery of the box, and Pamykos further deepens his connection with Reyk. We continue the ride to Athkatla, but stop to help a farmer who's had his livestock stolen by bandits! We make our presence known to the bandits, who we clearly outnumber, and they leave the livestock behind and run! The farmer, grateful, offers us some cheese of his own making "Sweaty Hill Cheese," which smells like Orc Sweat and tastes like Mutton according to Okurak. It goes with the rest of our cheese in the bag of holding, and on we go!
The next morning, Pyre's berrykin is still a little scared, but less than before. Pyre recalls the requirements to open Hokoki's box (Tentonite, some tinkering (high skill) and 12 levels worth of spell slots to infuse magical energy into it), and gets the box into the correct final position before the opening procedure, and Pamykos gets even closer to Reyk!
Pyre opens the box since we have the things we need, and gets an amulet from it that Pamykos names as an Amulet of Hokoki, which lets the user expend an action and a spell slot to alter the weather conditions for a minute at a time, and cast a selection of weather-related spells if they're strong enough and unlock enough of the amulet's power! Pamykos also identifies the boots Okurak collected as the Boots of Fleet Foot!
Returning to Athkatla, things seem a little different. There's more security, and a lot more people coming and going, and the streets are adorned with festive banners and fairground-style attractions. A local tells us there's a new governor, who's set to make an announcement in Riverside later today! No one's sure what's happened to Lorrus, and no-one's really sure who the new governor is, though they supposedly have a very short name. This can't be good. We go to see Eldric at the adventurer's guild since we asked him to keep an eye out. He doesn't seem to know more than anyone else, though. We take a look at his latest curios, though. Pyre buys for Gideon a card that can restore vitality to ones genitals if flicked against one. He doesn't have much guidance for us about what we can do now beyond waiting for this announcement.
We head to see the Bardacious Bunch and apologise for missing our plans with them the night after Bumberton's ball, explaining something urgent came up in the north. They accept our apology, and their leader talks with us about the goings on in the city, not really offering new information, but he seems trustworthy enough. We learn it's a candle or two 'til the announcement. Pyre checks with Skug to see if there are any instruments for sale, and there aren't, but he's willing to work on creating the first Keytar for Pamykos. Skug was willing to do the job for 5 gold, but Pamykos and Pyre fork over 10 each, with Pamykos being determined that this instrument shall be legendary!
Pamykos, Pyre, and Skug get to work with some random materials, including Pyre's tinkering components and even the high-potential Arcanite gem Pamykos had! Skug and Pyre tinker away with Pamykos providing inspiration and musical touches. Skug works at an unimaginable pace, especially once the Arcanite comes into play, and the end result is an instrument unlike any ever seen, which turns the heads of the whole pub as Pamykos dedicates it to Damh, the Satyr god of song, dance, and celebration, and lets out a few electric riffs. And just in time for the announcement!
We head outside as trumpets sound, and see the high council, which includes doppelgangers of the people we saved from the tower - Potraya, Manbridge, Vishalu Utrir, and Olessa Indito! They announce that they elected a new governor after discovering corruption and a plot to steal money from the townsfolk (a blatant lie), and the new governor and lord mayor, Governor Dart, a skinny-looking dwarf, takes the stage. Okurak immediately recognises him, declaring Dart a bastard.
Okurak explains that his old ship went down in a storm. He woke with nothing but his clothes and a small mysterious green gem. He had a vision in a dream where his old captain appeared and told him that Valkur, the god of sailors and ships, has plans for him, and that the shipwreck wasn’t an accident. Before being able to ask more, Okurak woke up with an amulet with Valkur’s symbol on it and cleric powers. Shortly after, he bumped into a member of his old crew called Dart, a very skinny and wheezy Dwarf, who Okurak never really liked and thought he was a coward that couldn’t last in a fight. Okurak got drunk with Dart, whose tale of the events of the shipwreck weren’t matching up with Okurak's, but he was too drunk to pay full attention. He stayed in Dart’s room and woke to find Dart and a hooded figure talking about an artifact and about its missing pieces. Dart noticed Okurak was awake and stabbed him with a dagger before escaping, and the hooded figure also disappeared. To cap it all off, the next morning the innkeeper kicked Okurak out and made him pay for a broken window since Dart owed him money.
Dart delivers a wheezing speech about honesty, new beginnings and his intentions for the city, which include a full two months of celebrations of a new start for Athkatla. The festival begins and it's not clear what we're meant to do next. Dart is clearly affiliated with either the Celestine Dawn, the Thieves Guild, or both! We speculate about tracking down Atara Wenmore, the lady we saved from being copied down in the sewers, or one of the cloned victims who we freed from the tower (whereabouts unknown!) to get more information about the other council members to prove the copying.
Once we have a means of proving what's happened, Okurak and Pamykos suggest we use a concert with the Bardacious Bunch to expose the cult and the thieves guild live on stage to the people of the city! After that, the villains won't be able to hide any more!
For now though, we have some business to attend to. We head to the trade district to have the apothecary make a potion with Pixie Fire and Deathroot for our time-travelling acquaintance. She whips the draught up for us, a vile-looking drink, and passes it to us. We go to see the quartermaster (that sicko) and deliver the beholder gland juice. After being disgusting for a moment, he agrees to send Verbobonc relief supplies on credit.
We still need to hand the draught to the time-traveller, and Pamykos wants to work with Skug on reinforcements to the keytar to protect it on his adventures. Okurak’s armour is nearly ready, needing only a couple more days.
31/8/23
We head to Bonkn't (the armour enchanter who has that thing called Snoofy as a slave) to check in on Okurak's dragonscale armour (this may be a slight retcon since there used to be two blacksmiths) and ask about getting the keytar enchanted and reinforced for more power and to be kept intact despite the adventuring lifestyle.
Snoofy suggests the armour is ready while his master indicates that it isn't quite ready in a slightly suspicious fashion. Okurak intimidates him into bringing the armour out since it turns out it is ready after all. The blacksmith Sirion blames this on Snoofy not telling him it was ready.
Pamykos still wants to have his keytar worked on, but is slightly suspicious and so opens negotiations. Sirion wants 3000 gold for it, but is willing to lower that price if I can bring him more magic gemstones, enchantment materials, ores or reinforcement materials. Pamykos arranges and signs a contract with Sirion via the Permit Hermit and that bureacratic department of Athkatla to make sure neither party is wronged, given the suspicious actions of Sirion regarding Okurak's armour and the unique nature of the keytar. With the contract signed, Pamykos leaves the Keytar with Sirion and Snoofy.
Okurak prepares a location by the seaside to cast word of recall, so we can warp back to Athkatla in an emergency (although our horses would be left behind in such an instance).
We run into Lorrus on our way back through the city! He and his men are loading a cart for Lorrus to leave! He explains he was voted out in an emergency meeting, and that we were right - he shouldn't have trusted the thieves' guild - the Celestine Dawn controlled doppelgangers must have threatened the one person they couldn't copy and just like that Lorrus was out! He plans to head to Verbobonc, thinking it should be safe thanks to our efforts. We ask if there is anyone still loyal to him we can trust, and he introduces to Garret, a member of The Order of the Dragon's Claw, the mercenaries under contract to guard the city. Garret, however, is loyal to more than just money, and is willing to help. He gives us a secret location we can arrange to meet him at.
We head to go see Elderon, our time traveller friend, and give him what he needs. He's at the inn as before, where we'll also need to stay the night before heading on. We find him at the bar and he's very drunk. Okurak sobers him up and he starts majorly panicking, calling us by name, and also calling us Lords! It seems he's learned our names and is worried about altering the future now he knows who we are!
Even once we calm him down, he won't say anymore, but he's willing to conclude business with him taking the draught, even though we don't have a place for him to stay or anything to guard him yet. Regardless, he turns over the rewards, namely his fancy pocket watch and a +1 dagger of returning, and leaves to go figure out his way Back To the Future! Maybe Athkatla has a clock tower and there's a lightning storm in the forecast?
We stay the night at the inn, and the next morning Pyre tinkers with the amulet of Hokoki, pouring some magic into it. He also interacts with his Berrykin, which goes very well! No new progress with Reyk today for Pamykos. Sirrush isn't able to progress with awakening the power of his new battleaxe.
Okurak performs some scrying to spy on Elderon of the Future, to see what happened to him after he took the sleeping draught and left, only to find he's on a ship travelling across the ocean.
With our business in town concluded for now, we decide to make for the Underdark, following the route that the Orc Warband had planned before we scattered them. The route is expected to take four days, going back over some of the way we travelled from Athkatla into the mountains last time. The first three days of travel are uneventful, but on the last, we find ourselves catching up with a merchant caravan. They are willing to open their stores (which include general wares as well as a smith for repairs) to us in exchange for payment. Okurak buys some bath supplies and pays with a story about how he became a cleric and how much of a jerk Dart is. Sirrush buys some glass jars for more acid bombs, swapping some cheese, but it turns out the glass isn't good enough for Acid. Sirrush still have to pay cheese since they melted a jar, but Sirrush handed over a slice of Brieholder, which made the merchant pass right out.
The night is peaceful and the morning is too. Pamykos and Reyk connect further, with the Raven now willing to listen to his master's commands. Pamykos sets him free from his cage, gives him some birdseed and mealworms, and commands him to watch the camp, send a warning signal to Pamykos if something goes bad at camp, and wait for Pamykos to either return or send word. Reyk takes roost in the trees nearby. We make for the cave entrance from Grimgore's map, and, having secured our horses at camp, we head down into the caves, using the driftglobe to shine the way (for Sirrush at least, since he lacks darkvision), and the spoon of warning tied to Gideon's forehead as usual.
12/10/23
Heading down the tunnel, we meet another dragonborn who knows Sirrush. Dredon comes busting through a wall and introduces himself. He also reveals that Sirrush's family is alive! Amazed, Sirrush feels he has no choice to go and see them, so he hands Dredon his adventuring gear and bids us farewell!
We explain our story to Dredon and venture onwards. We come to a room full of three crates, which Dredon immediately moves to smash, but it turns out that the first one he hits is a mimic!
Combat ensues and it briefly eats Pamykos, but Gideon smites it and slays it. Pamykos comes tumbling out, having found a superior healing potion (which he gives to Dredon), a bag of beans (with 8 beans), potion of stone giant strength, and a potion of acid resistance, which didn't seem to be enough to stop the mimic's previous occupant being dissolved down to the bones.
Pamykos gives the beans to Pyre who immediately plants one, causing a Bulette to appear and attack! Thankfully, Dredon was expecting trouble and grappled it, allowing us to defeat it with ease. Unfortunately, Pyre and Dredon plant another one together, causing an enormous 60ft pyramid to emerge from the ground, destroying the room and raising the cave roof! Despite the spoon of warning furiously vibrating, Dredon and Pyre immediately lead the way in!
A sarcophagus lies inside, immediately opening as we arriving and a Mummy Lord lurches out to attack us! A terrible fight ensues in which the mummy curses Pamykos and Okurak with mummy rot, which can be cleansed by remove curse, which Okurak doesn't have prepared at the moment but should have ready tomorrow!
In the sarcophagus, Pyre finds and pockets an Aurathyst gem, and we all find 100g worth of rare loot in the pyramid.
26/10/23
With all of the mummy lord nonsense dealt with, we headed back to camp for a rest day, with Okurak curing our curses of mummy rot. The next day, it comes time to proceed down the tunnels. Pyre gives another bean from the bag to Okurak, who just pockets it for later.
We arrive in a glowing mushroom-filled cave, and Okurak immediately decides to eat one. Even though it hurts him and leaves his mouth glowing, Pyre also eats some. The caves are filled with water at around ankle/knee height, and Okurak splashes his way boldly forwards, with no care for stealth. The rest of us follow, Pyre and Dredon talking loudly. Reaching a fork in the road, Okurak can't hear anything from either side, so we head on northwards.
As he head into a chamber at the end of the tunnel, the water swirls into a pair of water elementals, one large and one small, who attack - gripping Okurak in the tide and pulling him inside the larger elemental, pushing Gideon and Dredon to the edges of the chamber.
Combat ensues, with Pyre partially freezing the larger one and Pamykos blasting the smaller one, while Dredon and Gideon duel the elementals, who have formed tridents from ice. Okurak launches a thunder wave from the inside of the larger one, freeing himself from it's grasp and pushing it against the cave wall, blowing chunks of ice away from the frozen part. Gideon then charges the larger elemental and splits it down the middle, dispersing it back into the water pool. Pamykos blasts the last one into rain with an eldritch blast.
Searching the room, we find an altar in one corner with a skeleton lying next to it, clutching a very soggy book. Okurak hands the book to Pamykos, but before anything can be read, Dredon lies on the altar and a spectral figure named Bartholomew Blunderbeard appears above the skeleton. He wants us to open this altar so he can move on from this world. Dredon spots an inscription on the altar which Pamykos translates as instructions to "feed me something of worth, rub your belly and pat your head while chanting abracadabra backwards." We do this, with Okruak offering the bean, and the altar opens with a cackle to reveal a wand. The ghost, satisfied, fades away. Most of us are surprised he gave us no thanks.
Pamykos determines the wand to be a Wand of Mischief, which can cast random spells once a day, to a level that the wielder could cast. Pyre takes it and gives it a go, forming a telepathic bond with most of the party for an hour, though Pamykos respectfully declines, having had enough of voices in his head.
Pamykos inspects the book, which turns out to be Blunderbeard's diary, outlining the deceased fellow's trials as he explored these caverns, beguiling the water elementals with humour, being granted safe passage by the resident of a huge underwater lake, diving down a hole at the centre of it and finding the entrance to the underdark! The guardian demanded a worthy offering, for which he used his most valuable magic item. The diary also warns of creatures of unspeakable malevolence, and ends with him saying he found this altar on the way back up and out.
Lost Explorer’s Journal - Trials and Tribulations of Bartholomew Blunderbeard

Entry 1:
Today, I swam through the wondrous underwater caverns, answering the water elemental's riddles with wit and charm. It seems even elementals appreciate a good sense of humor!
Entry 2:
Incredible news! I stumbled upon a hidden entrance in the cave, leading me to a marvellous underground lake. The creature that I met there sensed my good intentions and granted me safe passage.
Entry 3:
As fate would have it, I found myself plummeting down a hole in the center of the lake, trusting blindly in the divine forces that guided me. Miraculously, I landed in a series of magical pools below, unharmed!
Entry 4:
My journey reached new depths as I encountered the entrance to the fabled underdark. However, the guardian demanded a worthy offering. With a heavy heart, I reluctantly parted with my most valuable magical item.
Entry 5:
I mustered my courage and ventured further into the underdark, only to be greeted by creatures of unspeakable malevolence. Alas, I made a hasty retreat, deciding to return to report on my discoveries. Intrigued by the last part of the underwater cavern on my way out I discovered a mysterious underwater altar that piqued my curiosity. I shall study its inscription before returning.
We head the other way down the tunnel fork, and find a chamber with 5 more altars submerged in the water. As we enter, another huge water elemental swirls into form. He introduces himself as Athgar the Ancient, and is angry at us for slaying his kin. We must individually pass riddles and clear our intentions to be granted safe passage. Gideon goes first, passing the riddle easily. Pyre, Pamykos, Okurak, and Dredon also all easily pass. Athgar tells us that the elements will not impede us, and grants us a blessing of water so we can travel freely.
Moving onwards, we come to another chamber with three alcolves. One has a huge mushroom, which Dredon takes a bite out of, which goes as well as expected. Another has a ritual circle of runes, in a Drow dialect, which explain that we could summon a Drow spirit to answer questions in exchange for a transfer of life energy to appease the old gods. Okurak offers some blood, and the spirit, Alfwen, tells us that the passage Northwest holds the path to the underdark. She explains that we will find plants of healing and traps before the entrance. She also mentions the guardian between the two realms, but refuses to tell us what the weaknesses are, just explaining that a worthy offering of magic items or money or such would be necessary. The healing plants in the caves here would not be worthy.
As we proceed, with some assistance from his god, Okurak is able to acquire one portion of healing algae for each of us. Dredon reckons it'll work fairly well but will rot within a day and might make us a bit queasy, so we consume them all so they can't rot away. In the northwest, we search for the hidden entrance, and find a section of thick plants we can push through, which we do, and soon we find the huge underground lake we were looking for.
Gideon runs up to the lake, the water disturbs and the top half of a beautiful woman (with four breasts, apparently) emerges from the lake's surface. She tests our intentions, lets us pass and sinks back into the water, leaving us to make our way across the lake.
We each cross the lake in our own way. Pamykos sneaks across, Okurak and Pyre warily make their way across the water, Dredon swims and has to slap away an attacking fish. Gideon tries to swim after Dredon and something starts to pull them down beneath the water and has to misty step away. We all make it down the hole in the lake, and are suddenly falling toward another lake. Okurak casts featherfall and we slowly drift downward onto the next lake, which we follow toward the one tunnel out. Gideon's spoon of warning triggers as we near the tunnel, along with a sense of ancient foreboding presence and power.
As we enter the next chamber, we see a huge ancient door in the distance, behind a small lake, and before us stands the guardian, who demands tribute from us. Most of our magic items don't interest him, though, with him wanting our most powerful possible items.
Dredon plants a bean to see if it would grow something worthy, but the vines that sprout out from the bean change both him and Pyre into women!
In the end, we conclude that the price he asks isn't worth it, so we decide we're fighting him, and Okurak uses the horn of blasting on him. The guardian declares that we will face the wrath of Kargaxx Garanasus, and battle begins.
16/11/23
We battle Kargaxx Garanasus, guardian of the underdark. He responds to our attacks with rays of frost and manipulating the water of the lake to surge and push us around. Pamykos dodges a surge of water that knocks Okurak and Gideon into a pool of water, only to meet Kargaxx’s blade. Okurak charges back in with a booming blade attack which Kargaxx fails to dodge. However, Kargaxx plunges his greatsword into the ground, dives into the pool and reemerges as a huge white dragon, his scales tinted an icy blue. Dredon tries to use the longbow of force but Kargaxx unleashes a cone of frost breath on him(her?) along with Pamykos and Okurak. Pamykos is knocked down with a coating of frost, but Gideon heals him. Kargaxx summons and freezes another wall of water, freezing Gideon, though Dredon manages to escape before it turns to ice. We scatter to avoid its attacks, and it attacks Pyre, taking to the skies again. It lets out frightening roars and summons a winter wolf to attack Pamykos.
Gideon spears the dragon’s wings with javelins and Pyre summons a draconic spirit to carry Dredon up to Kargaxx’s height. Okurak unleashes a potent thunderwave, which combined with the javelins bring the dragon to ground level. Kargaxx tried and fails to coerce the draconic spirit to its side, and Pamykos frightens the winter wolf away with dissonant whispers. Kargaxx freezes Gideon and downs Okurak (who transformed into bear form from earlier wounds) using another wall of freezing water, but the Draconic spirit rakes across the dragon’s neck and brings it down. The winter wolf flees as the dragon dies, and a white-blue essence rises up from the dragon and transfers into Dredon’s axe, imbuing it with new strength. Pamykos revives Gideon, who heals everyone else.
The dragon drops two rings, and we find a stash of 1500gp, probably a sliver of this dragon’s hoard. Dredon plucks Kargaxx’s greatsword from the earth. The rings are a Ring of Free Action and a Ring of X-Ray Vision respectively, which go to Gideon, and the greatsword is a stirring Dragon’s Wrath Greatsword, which Okurak takes. Pamykos is also given Sirrush’s old amulet of health, since Dredon doesn’t need it, though he will have to attune to it when the party rests.
The huge door to the underdark is no longer magically sealed, and creaks open. Through it lies a platform with a dome of magical energy on it - the portal to the underdark. We feel energised by our victory, and don’t know if it’s safe to camp here if monsters could come through the portal, so we head on through the portal, emerging in the underdark. It turns out that the portal’s other side lies in an isolated region, so we consider resting, but Dredon is bored and tries to cross the river to explore the rest of the region. (s)He doesn’t find much, so he comes back and agrees to take first watch alongside Okurak while we camp out. Gideon is on the second watch and sees a couple of ratty-looking gnomish creatures poking around Dredon while he sleeps across the river from the rest of us. Gideon tries to sneak up on them but they hear him and flee. The rest of the camping time passes uneventfully, though Dredon wakes up with weird mucus on their head. During the rest, Pamykos attunes to the amulet of health and Okurak uses the Tome of Rebalancing we received from the druid Ayana after we saved Verbobonc. The next morning, Pyre checks in with his berrykin and ponders The Amulet of Hokoki, unlocking more of its secrets and enabling it to release dust devils as another option.
Gideon investigates the slime and determines it probably came from some kind of creature. They both taste the saliva and find it rancid. We set out to explore the surrounding area, and a talking Llama surprises a Okurak and Dredon as they explore, gives off a crazy speech and then spits in Dredon’s face! The Llama, whose name is Stingston Stallone, apologises profusely for that last part and explains how his experiments in inter-planar travel failed and polymorphed him into a Llama! He wants our help to get him transformed back, and in exchange he offers information. Dredon also demands the ring that Stingston was trying to enchant, and Pyre requests a copy of his research, which Stingston is willing to grant. He explains that the things that dribbled on Dredon’s head must have been Svirfneblin. He agrees to tell us where to find the flower we seek to cure old bum once we’ve helped, and says he’s seen no orc activity. He also says he may have some information on the weapon we’re trying to find, and Okurak thinks he seems trustworthy.
Stingston wants us to climb up to where he had opened an unstable portal, and an arcana expert could shut the portal off by finishing the casting process of the nexus thinning spell. He says that he forgot to wear his vortex ring, which will protect the wearer from polymorph effects, but it should be somewhere up there.
The portal is surrounded by all kinds of strange objects, including inside-out chairs and orange potatoes, twisted by the unstable magic. Pyre tries to rush for the book containing the ritual, which rests on a distorted podium, but fails to incant it correctly. The orb releases a pulse that turns Gideon into a worm, which Dredon pockets. Pamykos gives it a go, but fails, and the orb polymorphs Dredon into a cute penguin. Pamykos does manage to spot the ring, grabbing it and putting it on. He resumes trying to figure the ritual out, and in the process Dredon gets turned into a three headed duck, but eventually gets it right, but the piece of Arconite he was using to open the portal turns into a peanut as the portal closes. Ducktor Dre has just enough time to snap the peanut up before turning back into a human, and everyone else turns back too.
Stingston freaks out about the loss of his arconite, delivers his crazy speech again, and spits in our faces again, which has apparently become a habit. He points us in the direction of the flower for Old Bum, explains he’s seen a few orcs around but not many, warns us about a powerful local Drow cult that is built around an artefact - an ancient magical shield - in the possession of one central drow family, and the queen at the family’s head. Stingston sometimes transforms himself into a drow to trade with them, and he’s learned that some of the drow in the cult are unhappy with the balance of power, so he offers to make us all look like Drow so we can sneak in and make this happen. The enchantment also allows us to speak and understand Drow.
We take him up on the offer, and as we begin to finalise our plans, Dredon decides to plant another magic bean.
30/11/23

Dredon’s latest magic bean causes 11 huge mushrooms to sprout from the ground. Naturally, Dredon and Okurak go to eat them, and the mushrooms emit a piercing scream. Shriekers! Somehow, this doesn’t really deter Okurak or Dredon, as Okurak screams back at them and they both bite some off, finding the mushrooms quite bitter.
We move on and encounter a small militia of 15 Duergar, who try to enlist our help, offering a reward. They’re trying to raid a local Svirfneblin village, but have angered a giant ant’s nest in their way. They want us to kill the ants and clear a path, but we don’t fancy allowing them to raid an innocent village, so combat ensues. Simon briefly turns invisible due to a wild magic surge. Once we kill more than half of the Duergar, one of them calls for retreat and they begin to leave, though not without the magic of Okurak’s booming blade stinging them in the arse on the way out, and Pyre incinerates another as they flee. Pamykos yells after them telling them not to return.
Looting the raiders, we don’t find anything crazy, mostly just basic raiding equipment and a couple of pickaxes, but we do find 500g and some gems - namely a Jet, a Spinel, and a Tourmaline (100g each); a Citrine and a Zircon (50g); and an Emerald (1000g), some blue quartz, lapis lazuli, and hematite (10g each), and a Topaz (500g) and a Peridot (500g). Gideon gets the 10g gems and the Spinel for use with his magic shield, and Pamykos takes the Peridot to help pay for the Keytar when he returns to town. We also find two potions of greater healing (which go to Gideon), plus one superior (to Okurak) and two standard (split between Pyre and Pamykos), and some elven chain armour that seems well suited to Pyre. The remaining gems go in the bag of holding.
Okurak heals our wounds and we move on through the caverns. We know from Stingston’s advice where to find the trading post and the flower we need for Old Bum, so we head for the flower first. Pamykos sneaks ahead and identifies a pitfall trap, warning the others.
Reaching the flower, we find two Svirfneblin have just picked it! They’re startled by our presence, and there don’t seem to be any other flowers present! One of them sticks the flower in his mouth and the other tries to ransom it to us for 200 gold! Pamykos persuades them to cough it up free of charge after Pyre and Okurak each threaten them, and they hand it over. Pyre gives them one gold and they take it and scarper.
On our way back towards the trading post, Okurak decides to throw a decent-sized rock on the trap. It gets pushed into a nearby pit and impaled on a huge spike. Pamykos finds the mechanism fascinating and suggests Pyre have a look, but Pyre can’t fully figure it out, understanding some of how it works. We stop for a moment to plan before we reach the trading post, trying to come up with a Drow clan name to pretend we’ve come from. Okurak confidently comes up with an incredibly inaccurate choice of “Wu Tang.” and he’s so adamant about it being a good choice that Pamykos doesn’t get to suggest something correct!
The atmosphere at the trading post is tense. Many different clans are here, but it looks like they’re moments from killing each other. We identify the clan Stingston told us about, and head to their table. Pyre browses their wares, purchasing a Wand of the War Mage +1, and a Coin of Certainty that always lands on heads, and he and Pamykos ask about the orcs that have been coming down here. The merchant, annoyed about the orc warbands, tells us he found some of them skulking around near the clan walls and sent them packing back toward the portal, presumably where we came from.
Naturally, because we’re in a place of commerce, Jizrek shows up! Okurak, not interested in keeping cover, tells Jizrek it’s us, though he seems to know this and has more items to sell. The Drow here are extremely confused by his presence. Okurak buys a trident for 20g (which he gives to Gideon) and a ring for 10g, and Jizrek tries to sell Pyre a magic tome and a cube for intelligent people (which he gives to Okurak, a true paragon of intelligence), which Pyre buys. Pyre also buys Pamykos a gift of a tiny violin, and some magic boots for Dredon. Jizrek also has a gift for Okurak since Okurak was kind enough to give Gideon the trident. Jizrek hands Okurak a torch and the next time we try to look for him, he’s gone - to where, we do not know!
Some of the Drow merchants ask us if we’re really as strong as Jizrek has been bigging us up to be, and after Okurak proves that we killed a Dragon yesterday, they decide it’s worth asking for our help with their problems. These are the Drow Stingston mentioned who want to overthrow the queen in charge of their clan, and they explain that if we fight against Queen Salthandra and her four champions - namely an Archon (with powerful magic), a Support (a healer), a Reaver (with a big sword) and a Shadowblade (a sneaky archer with dangerous assassination potential up close) - and win control of the clan for them, they’ll give us the shield, which according to some babbling historian they killed a ways back is a Shield not of this Earth which came from the gods themselves!
We agree, and the Merchant takes us back to the clan headquarters and puts us up for the night. He will go to the queen to issue his ritual challenge tonight, and tomorrow, we fight the queen and her champions.
Pamykos identifies . The Trident is a Trident of dampening, which can make its victims clothes improperly dried at will. The Tome doesn’t seem malevolent, but does seem to have powerful magic within that Pamykos can’t quite discern, so Pyre keeps it to open under more secure circumstances. The ring is a ring of invisibility - but it only turns itself invisible. The boots are Boots of Striding, but one of them is fake. Lastly, the tiny violin plays itself whenever its owner discusses their past.
Each face of the puzzle cube consists of a 3 by 3 grid of squares of 6 different colours in total, all jumbled up into a different arrangement. It looks as though each column or row could be rotated to the other faces, so in theory you could make every face all one colour.
As it turns out, however, it cannot be manipulated at all, as if it is fused in place. It radiates strong magic. Its purpose is to radiate strong magic. It changes the nature of what magic it radiates every hour. Evocation. Divination. Etc. - Pamykos recognises it to actually be an antique training device from yesteryear to help measure the success with which up and coming casters are at casting detect magic. It does nothing else. Unless you place it on a convergence of three ley lines beneath a full moon. Then. By a quirk of its construction. It will pop three feet into the air and spin around rapidly. As soon as anyone touches it. It makes a farting noise and vanishes. It reappears upon the desk of the archmage Vinculus - 300 years ago! He was looking for that.
We rest for the night, and in the morning we prepare for the fight. Pyre interacts with his berrykin and tinkers with Hokoki’s box. Dredon tries and fails to meditate with his Axe. We take a bit of time to plan some strategy and consider any spells to cast.
Entering the arena, we see a crowd of Drow lining the arena’s edge, and the queen and her champions stand before us - the queen in front bearing a resplendent, shimmering magic shield that emanates electric energy. The Drow elders declare the challenge has begun, and we shall now battle to the death! The Archon begins the battle with a fireball directly towards our group! Pamykos retaliates with a Mind Whip to the Queen’s entourage, interfering with all but the Archon. The Queen charges the party and calls down a flamestrike.
Pyre summons a green draconic spirit, and a wild magic surge blasts the queen and her reaver with lightning as the spirit unleashes poison breath upon the other champions. The battle rages onwards as Dredon goes rage-to-rage against the Reaver and Gideon slays the Archon with his flail, moving with an incredible haste thanks to Okurak’s magic.
14/12/23
The battle continues. Okurak banishes the healer to another plane for a bit, and the hasted Gideon fells the Shadowblade. Dredon grapples the Reaver and we focus on him and the queen until Okurak is hit, losing his focus and returning the healer to this plane. Gideon engages the healer while an enraged Dredon unleashes a spree of brutal attacks that split the Reaver in two. The queen taunts Pyre into attacking her, and his loss of focus makes the draconic spirit dissipate. The healer refreshes herself as we try to bring her down and Dredon grapples the queen. Pyre breaks free from the Queen’s magical taunt, but she taunts Pamykos next. Okurak, who has transformed into a bear from the stress of battle, claws out the healer’s throat, leaving only the Queen to fight.
The queen tries to yield, but the elders remind her this is a fight to the death. Pamykos breaks free of the taunt, but not before stabbing the queen, and he then forces her to dance with magic. She breaks free from this before too long, but by this point everyone’s attacks are focused on her. Gideon hits her with a smite so devastating it blasts her face off. No sooner than her body hits the ground than Okurak asks us to gather around, picks up the shield, and activates the word of recall to return us all the way back to the beach on Athkatla! Better than risking the Drow double-crossing us. We dismiss the magic keeping us disguised as Drow.
Pamykos reaches psychically out to Reyk, who has flown back to Athkatla anticipating our return and lands on Pamykos’ shoulder. He is promptly fed some nice treats. We decide to head to the inn and rest up. Pamykos tries to identify the shield, but all he can determine is that it grants additional protection beyond what a normal shield is capable of. Gideon takes it for future use. The next morning (after seeing to our usual routines - Pamykos didn’t develop Reyk’s connection, Pyre furthered his berrykin friendship, but couldn’t decipher the box more, and Dredon forgot to do his daily meditation), Okurak and Dredon both went shopping. Okurak sold some stuff and bought spell components (and commissioned a gem-encrusted cup for that purpose too), and both bought some items from Jizrek. Dredon a totally magic ring, Pyre bought a ring of the grammarian and Okurak buys an amulet of pronunciation, as well as a magic comb though none of these are identified yet.
29/02/24
Pamykos identifies the magic items the group has bought. The comb makes you go bald, The Ring of the Grammarian lets you alter the name of spells to change the effect. The amulet of pronunciation causes its owner to pronounce all silent letters. Dredon’s totally magic ring turns out to be a ring of invisibility!
Okurak decides now is the time to open the magic tome we found before in the underdark (the one we were saving for later) - the moment it opens, a very cuddly cat springs forth from the binding and lays down on the pages, covering all of the words up! No attempt to move the cat or coax it away works, and using force just causes the book to close!
After hearing some townsfolk excitedly chattering about the many events at the faire that the new governor has set up, and looking forward to the arena, we decide to check out the faire events. There’s Ostrich racing, bare-knuckle boxing, and more, and there are notices stating that entry is open with prizes to be won based on how people do across all of the various events. Okurak and Gideon decide we should compete, so we decide to give it a go.
First up is Ostrich racing, where a gnome named Gazrahn(?) challenges all to see if they can beat his lap records. We all attempt feats of Animal Handling to mount our steeds, Athletics to stay on, and Performance to look good doing it, then Acrobatics to rebalance after the performances. In the end, Okurak wins followed very closely by Pyre! A warlock named Lenith and a Warlock named Bulgon follow next, then Pamykos, Dredon, Akurath the fighter, Gideon, Glanayel the Bard, and lastly Solnar the rogue.
The next event is a Talent Show - Dredon does a load of push-ups, leaving everyone impressed! That Bulgon guy tries to do pull-ups, but it’s not much for a Barbarian. Pamykos recites a dramatic monologue from a famous play, wowing the audience. Dredon necks a yard of ale really fast. Gideon balances in a frog pose, which is pretty impressive. Akurath does a large-ish but not very belchy burp. The Bard does some funny but slightly awkward dancing. The Rogue tries to accurately throw grapes into a cup from a distance but misses three times. Pyre does an excellent handstand! The Warlock puts his tongue up both of his nostrils, which is gross but also pretty cool.
Next is a tug-of-war, with us versus the other 5 people. With the power of teamwork, we win resoundingly!
Next up is target practice. Unfortunately, we all do pretty terribly here, except for Gideon who did very well, so the other party of 5 should close the gap.
Next is either bare-knuckle-boxing or Arcane Duels, best of three. Pyre duels Lenith the Warlock and loses. Dredon duels Bulgon and lost. Okurak loses to Akurath. Gideon wins against Solnar. Pamykos loses to Glanayel.
Finally comes a drinking competition. Everyone passes Round 1. Lenith passes out in Round 2. Akurath passes out in Round 3, but everyone else, Pamykos just about included, makes it through. Bulgon, Gideon, Pamykos, Pyre, Solnar, and Glanayel all pass out in Round 4. Dredon and Gideon continue on. Round 5 claims everyone else!
When all is said and done, Solnar the fumbling rogue is last, then Bulgon, Lenith, Akurath, Pyre, Glanayel, Pamykos, Dredon, Okurak, and then Gideon in First Place! So we got 6th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st! (+5000XP!)
Those who placed in the top 5 each get to pick one of the five prizes in turn! There’s the Blazing Bowstring (ignites up to 3 arrows per long rest), the Band of the Dryad (heals a potions worth per day), coin-storing ring (stores coins up to 1000g and has 150g in it!), some “plate” armour made of fine china, and a mysterious ball that can answer questions. Gideon takes the Blazing Bowstring, Okurak the coin-storing ring, Dredon the “Mysterious Orb of the 8th”, and Pamykos takes the Band of the Dryad.
The organisers of this little tourney mention that the arena challenge is still to come tomorrow for any willing, and the winners of that will get to meet the new Lord Mayor. We are still looking to have some words with Dart, so we’ll likely go for that. There are also cash prizes starting from 250g per group!
The barkeeps wake everyone and kick them all out as the bar closes. Filled with wisdom and alcohol, we go on to another bar and stumble in on the annual dragonfire ale drinking contest, which Dredon, Okurak, Gideon and Pyre decide to compete in as Pamykos watches. Okurak wins 200 Gold for first place!
A drow lady in common clothes and a big hat walks in. Everyone is surprised, but since it looks like she doesn’t want trouble, everyone goes back to their business and she goes and sits down with a wealthy half-elf merchant. Okurak listens in and catches something about some quality wares the Drow have come into and are looking to sell to the half-elf. Okurak, for a laugh, uses a gust of wind to blast the two of them, sending her hat flying away, then goes in and apologises as he’s drunk. He and Pamykos convince him to use the Comb of Balding (which Gideon retrieves for us).
Next we’re invited to drink with some friendly dwarves, who share some unique ale, served with a bacon and pickle skewer of all things, which leaves us all feeling inspired in craftsmanship, and then invite us to a grand feast! Those of us who placed top five in the town faire are invited to try the Wine of Bol, a magical spirit. Okurak coughs up an Ioun Stone of Greater Absorption that lasts for a day. Pamykos coughs up a scroll of burning hands, Gideon gets a scroll of incendiary cloud, and Dredon gets a Candle of the Deep.
We decide to return to the inn and rest.
14(?)/03/24
Innkeeper was left with a couple of notes - 1 from Ermot inviting Okurak to the great hunt tomorrow night and 1 from Arabella and Ratan thanking us for sorting getting provisions sent to them. They said they found some items in the rubble that may be of use to us as they are no good for rebuilding - 10 +2 arrows, a tattoo scroll of gem dust (requires a magic gem and a tattoo artist/ink to apply a +1 to +4 increase in a statistic, requires attunement)
The next day brings the arena challenge, which is split into four elemental trials. The party passes the fire and water trials.
11/04/24
Next is the Earth trial. We must cross several stepping stones that are raised above the ground amidst a swirling mass of dirt and rocks. Pyre, Dredon, and Okurak perceive the pattern in the swirling earth and guide the others across before following across themselves, and as we each reach the centre platform, runes light up, beginning the process of summoning an Earth Elemental.
The Earth Elemental springs into life as the platforms erupt into uneven ground, but Dredon terrifies it with his raging presence. After the elemental traps Pyre in stone and throws up a blinding sandstorm, there’s a mishap where Pamykos, having observed the summoning runes and trying to discern the elemental’s name, tries to use Psychic Lance to attack the elemental. He must have been wrong about the name though, since the lance flies off and kills someone’s dog in the audience!
Okurak conjures a gust of wind to dispel the dust, push the elemental away, and clear a path to the elemental, allowing Dredon to close the distance again and keep attacking. Gideon joins the offensive and the elemental crumbles, the rocks that formed its body forming the steps to the next level.
The next level is full of howling winds, and the view of the centre is blocked by foggy clouds. As we step onto the platform, it breaks apart into a moving maze of platforms, and any step will move us into another stream of wind and send us in some new direction. Okurak looks for a pattern that will take us to the centre. He steps into it and is whirled away to where we wanted to go, and now needs to decide which direction to push off in. Pamykos leaps into the wind and manages to follow Okurak, though not without a scratch or two from some debris.
Dredon takes a tumble and is bludgeoned by the flying blocks, but Gideon nails it and makes it all the way to the middle. Pyre also figures it out. Pamykos times a push and makes it to the middle, but Okurak is cut off and left behind. Okurak follows and luckily makes it to the middle. Dredon corrects course and makes it to the middle, but as he arrives, runes spring to life and an air elemental attacks, pushing all of the other blocks away and leaving us floating in a strong updraft.
After the elemental fires lightning bolts at us, and whirling debris leaves some scratches, Gideon is able to banish the air elemental back to the elemental plane. The rest of the party rallies to try and protect Gideon’s concentration on the spell, or otherwise prepare to fight the elemental in case it manages to return. After a few moments without the elemental present, the arena calms down and we are lowered back to the platform. The commentator announces we are now approaching the final and deadliest challenge.
25/04/24
A large wind current blows upwards towards the final platform. Riding the currents, we come face to face with a massive Elemental amalgamation of all four primal elements, it roars at us and battle begins.
Pamykos opens up with a volley of eldritch blasts, but the Elemental’s energy shifts and absorbs it, shimmering as it does so. The terrain begins to shift around, forcing Okurak and Dredon to step out of the way before they can fall into a freshly-opened pit. Dredon charges into the fray with a brutal swing of his axe, but the elemental retaliates with an elemental blast that hits Dredon and Okurak and sends Pamykos diving away. The elemental focuses its ire on Dredon, but also attacks Gideon with a morphing limb of earthen shards surrounded by swirling elements.
After Pyre traps the amalgamation in a storm sphere, Okurak calls down lightning from the sky, but it absorbs that too and begins making a whirlwind which blasts outward, pushing Gideon, Dredon, and Okurak back. Pamykos hits it with a potent psychic lance, but it resists the worst of the effects, and Dredon, back on his feet, charges in once more as Gideon shoots at the elemental. One arrow misses and hits another dog in the crowd! Pyre is knocked over by shifting terrain, missing a chromatic orb.
Another blasting whirlwind knocks Okurak and Pamykos off of the platform! Thankfully, there are gusts of wind that can deliver us back to the platform. It shrugs off another psychic lance, and then charges itself up with the elemental energies of the arena, becoming more precise. Dredon continues to hack away at it, and Gideon peppers it with more arrows. Pyre gets another lightning bolt hit from the storm sphere, and then launches what would have been a devastating chromatic orb, but the elemental absorbs it! Okurak heals everyone up with a mass cure wounds.
Pamykos hits another psychic lance, which the elemental resists the worst of, but with greater effort than before. Then it infuses itself with the energies of the arena, restoring itself! Dredon takes revenge, hacking and slashing in a wild, reckless frenzy. The Elemental retaliates with a massive shockwave made of all of the energy it has absorbed! It leaves everyone much worse for wear, though Dredon, Pyre, and Gideon avoid the worst of it. Gideon unleashes a divine smite, but it absorbs the radiant energy. Pyre lands another lightning bolt, but it retaliates with a whirlwind that flings Pamykos off the platform, where the fall knocks him out! Okurak is able to revive him.
The arena begins to frost over, clinging at our heels, but Dredon climbs back up and resumed attacking, this time with his bow. The elemental goes for Gideon, flinging a boulder but missing, and then it suffers an internal eruption as it tries to attack with fire, billowing steam everywhere. Gideon goes toe-to-toe against the elemental with his flail, but it unleashes a blast cone on Dredon, Pyre, and Gideon, taking Dredon down. It absorbs another chromatic orb of acid from Pyre, but Okurak hits it with a destructive wave. Pamykos revives Dredon just in time for him to be lightly singed as the frost on the ground melts, giving way to pillars of fire.
The elemental is barely holding itself together, but it releases another burst of stored energy, which knocks out Okurak, Dredon, and Pamykos! Gideon almost slays it with his flail, and Pyre unleashes a snowball swarm that causes it to freeze and crumble away before exploding.
The crowd erupts in cheers, and the announcer declares us worthy warriors, who will face the final round another day. Some clerics come and revive those of us who are down, healing us to about half health, then they place us on a podium, bestowing us with a huge trophy, 2500 gold (500 each, also 10,000 XP!), and then we’re free to leave. Okurak, absolutely shattered suggests we go to the pub, and walks us to the first one he can find, which happens to be where we’ve been staying during our stay in Athkatla.
We’re recognised as the arena champions, with people buying us drinks and the like. Okurak asks for the strongest thing they have, which happens to be Mordenkainen’s Risky Whiskey. As he gulps it down, Okurak begins to hear the thoughts of all the patrons! Okurak tries to use his newfound psychic powers to wingman the guy who buys him a drink, along with a bit of guidance. The target of his affections seems to be in two minds about the guy, but at least she’s not disgusted.
Pamykos also tries the risky whiskey, erupting in exploding green pustules that spray acid everywhere! He has to heal some locals who get splashed.
Next, Okurak reads the mind of an Aarakocra who’s chugging drink after drink, angry about a guy named Barak who can drink more than him and therefore thinks he’s better than them. Okurak gives him a vial of dragon’s blood for him to really demonstrate his drinking prowess. It really messes with the bird, sending him into a mad rage against a random patron, causing a massive bar brawl. A dwarf attacks Pamykos, angry that he’s gotten acid on his friend. Pamykos headbutts the dwarf. The guy Okurak wingmanned, emboldened, goes in for a kiss, but gets slapped and the lady storms out. Enraged, he attacks Pyre, but misses. Gideon and Dredon end up fighting the Aarakocra. Someone tries to grab Okurak, and hits him when Okurak laughs him off, so Okurak punts him back with thunderous wrath. The barkeep gets involved, angry that trouble has broken out, but Okurak is able to calm things down by banishing the Aarakocra, and the barkeep rings the bell and enforces order. Pamykos has one more drink, this time of some relatively normal Gizzard’s Guff and goes off to bed, hoping that Okurak or someone in town can fix his face tomorrow. Gideon has a drink and fills his mouth with bubbles, which pairs nicely with the cotton-y feeling from the last drink. Okurak has another risky whiskey and casts fear on almost the whole bar! One mass panic and a chat with the barkeep later, everyone goes to bed. The night’s antics get us 2000 XP.
The next morning, Okurak removes Pamykos’ cursed pustules.
30/05/24
Pamykos doesn’t manage to connect with Reyk the raven, but his keytar is finally ready, so he goes and collects it, paying the remaining amount of 1500g. Pyre communes with the berrykin. Dredon can’t be bothered to do much of anything today after yesterday’s crazy battle, so he goes out drinking (never to be seen again?). Pyre also advances Hokoki’s box (arcana check + 2 lv4 slots).
Remembering that because we teleported back to Athkatla, we never returned that herb to Granny Flowers so she could make a potion for Old Bum, so we decide to head out and make the delivery. Unfortunately, we also left our horses in the mountains, so we go to rent some from Riverside. Okurak cures the “river muck” from the stable-keeper so he gets to rent a horse for free, and it gets renamed Okurak! Pyre and Pamykos have to pay 10 gold each (plus a 100 gold retainer each, which we’ll get back on our return) to rent Jezebel and Frederick for the day.
We arrive at Granny Flowers. Once she remembers who we are, she beckons us inside and offers some drinks. Okurak asks for “an experience” and gets a slight buzz, but Gideon asks for a drink that will teach them and ends up tripping balls, seeing demons, plants, and more. Gideon can also see a strange shadow lingering near Pamykos, who appears to have grown a large flower crown. Just as soon as it started it’s over. Granny Flowers flies into a rage about another slug on the path and needs to be banished into a timeout by Okurak again. She comes back calmer and turns to business.
She takes the herb we collected from the underdark and plants it in a pot, growing it into a beautiful vine of flowers. She then picks one flower and prepares a tincture for Old Bum with a wide variety of very gross ingredients. At one point she asks for blood and before Pamykos can ask any questions Okurak has already cut his hand open. She finishes the tincture and hands it over, and so we leave.
Because it’s a full moon, Okurak has been invited by the werebears to the great hunt, and we can all attend as guests! We head back to the secret cove in the forest where we met the werebear clan before. Rownar (the werebear leader) and Ermot (the clan’s Athkatla connection) are there, and Okurak goes to say hi to Ermot. Rownar is concerned by how Okurak nearly publicly transformed in yesterday’s arena battle, so they discuss it awhile. He accepts the justification we give them regarding the need to get to Mayor Dart, though.
Rownar also notes that Sirrush is no longer with us, so we explain the situation with Sirrush leaving, Dredon joining, and that Dredon isn’t currently with us. Since Dredon has seen Okurak transform in the time we travelled together, Rownar is even more concerned by that. We try to convince him that Dredon won’t blab since he doesn’t care enough to, but Rownar still says that the werebears will send someone to try and swear Dredon to secrecy.
Rownar explains the nights’ events. As the werebears run free through the woods, the rest of us can drink the clan’s dream herb brew and join as spiritual guides (and subsequently lose our memories of the night’s events). We do so (though Gideon and Pyre don’t handle the nausea of the brew very well, vomiting all over themselves and each other), and the great hunt begins.
Okurak, in bear form, is challenged by another werebear, and a fight begins. Sadly Okurak loses and backs away, the other bear charging off after the rest of the hunt. Gideon, guiding another werebear as a spirit, goes off on a solo mission, finding an ancient werebear burial site and spotting some grave robbers heading through the woods toward the site. Gideon intimidates them into dropping their shovels and running away, pissing and screaming. Pamykos, also as a spirit, guides a werebear to track the scent of corruption. He finds a hidden grove with some witches corrupting the local wildlife. He fetches the werebear Pyre is guiding, and together they attack the witches’ grove. One witch tries to fight but when Pamykos’ bear slashes her stomach, she drinks a potion and flees. With the witches’ influence gone, the forest begins to restore itself.
Okurak follows another trail and comes upon a group of druids and their animal companions. He approaches peacefully, and the lead druid feeds him and offers some ritualistic words, conveying the idea that Okurak could call on him for help in the future. Okurak marks the location and leaves. Gideon follows the pack and finds a female bear in heat, only to be challenged for the female by a male bear. Gideon’s bear wins, but doesn’t mate with the female since it’s just a regular wild bear. Pamykos also follows the pack and finds a part of the forest damaged by the movements of a large creature, then finds the strange-looking beast, a 6 limbed creature with a large round head. It seems lost and confused. Pamykos tries to guide it away, but confuses and angers it into attacking. The bear guided by Pamykos and two others fight the strange creature and ultimately are forced to kill it.
Okurak investigates alone and encounters an unnatural silence. This part of the forest has no sound at all. Nearby there is a village. One small hut has a light on, but something doesn’t feel right, and he can smell the sweat of an unwashed man. Peering into the hut he finds a thief rummaging around. The thief is scared by Okurak and drops his lantern to flee. Okurak rolls on the lantern to put out the flames, being burned in the process. Following the thief as he runs through the trees until the sounds return. Okurak pins the thief down, dislocating an arm, and then removes the thief’s bag of stolen goods, drools on the man and leaves, returning the stolen belongings to the hut, finding the silence spell has ended. Gideon follows the pack. One of the elders has caught the scent of something, coming to a precipice and roaring at a pack of werewolves in the distance. The two groups charge one another and battle ensues. Gideon guides the werebear to tear off a werewolf’s head, and then another, and then another! By that point the battle is over with some dead and others scattering to lick their wounds. The bears stand atop the hill and roar. Pamykos sees another bear and is challenged. He loses after the two bears flail wildly at one another.
As the moon descends over the horizon, the bears return to the grove and the rest of us awake from our trance. All of the werebears seem pretty banged up, and the spirit guides still feel like they’ve been running through the woods all night. Pamykos is able to hang on to a decently large amount of the night despite the brew, and shares a knowing nod with the bear he guided. Gideon is able to hang on to some bits and pieces of the night, and Okurak . Pyre remembers fuck all.
We head back to the city to sleep at the inn. The next day is the day of the final round of the tournament.
20/06/2024
Town criers shouting the arena battle has been delayed by a day.
Pyre went to temple of Gond, asked Gond who/where his parents are. Told his father is in baldur’s gate.
The party meets Zat, a druid sent by the werebears to ensure Dredon’s silence. Dredon refuses, however, so he is feebleminded and killed by Zat, who buries Dredon on the beach with Okurak’s help, though Dredon still has one of the mystery magic beans in his pocket.
Ambushed by Akuji and his monstrosities in a dark part of town after some road closures diverted the group.
As you enter the dimly lit alleyway, you find, a figure steps out from the shadows, seemingly an eerie amalgamation of gnomish ingenuity and monstrous perversion. This diminutive figure, no more than three and a half feet tall, is a grotesque sight. His pale, almost translucent skin is crisscrossed with the scars of countless experiments, and his once bright gnome eyes now glow with a sickly green luminescence.
His small frame is draped in a patchwork robe of dark leathers and arcane symbols, each stitch holding dark secrets and vile substances. His hands, though small, are tipped with unnaturally long, sharp claws. A constant, unsettling chittering sound seems to emanate from him, the result of his twisted physiology.
He raises his head, his sickly green eyes glowing with a malevolent light, and a twisted smile spreads across his scarred face.
"Ah, the famed Heroes of Verbobonc," Akuji sneers, his voice a chilling mix of gnome and something far more sinister. "I've heard so much about your exploits. Lord Fazrahl has tasked me with your demise, and I must say, I've been eagerly anticipating this moment."
He gestures to the twisted abominations caged around the room, their grotesque forms writhing and snarling. "You see, I've been working on some... new experiments. Fresh creations that need proper testing. And what better subjects than the so-called heroes who think they can thwart our grand design?"
Akuji's smile widens, revealing sharp, inhuman teeth. "Prepare yourselves. I will not fail Lord Fazrahl. And you will be the first to witness the true extent of my genius."
As the battle with the Heroes of Verbobonc rages, Akuji reveals his horrific transformation. With a maniacal laugh, he taps into his dark powers, morphing into a terrifying hybrid creature. His gnome features stretch and distort as he grows larger, sprouting additional limbs and scales. His skin takes on a hardened, almost insectoid quality, and his eyes multiply, giving him an otherworldly visage.

25/07/2024
The party loots Akuji’s body, finding a hand crossbow as well as 5 modified bolts with potion vials on the ends. There is also a journal, 4 more potions and a mysterious looking orb.
Pamykos identifies the crossbow as magical, seeking its targets within 30 feet, but unable to crit. The orb seems to hold some kind of teleportation magic but it seems somewhat unstable, but Pamykos is unable to decipher how to use it. The bolt-potions hold a kind of wild magic. The regular potions are one of confusion, one of illusory terrain, one of thunder wave, one draught of haste.
Reading Akuji’s diary, we learn that he joined the Celestine Dawn after Fazrahl recognised his skills at hybridising different creatures. Akuji describes his experiments and having worked in a mountain laboratory. His notes also reveal that when we were originally captured we were set to be experimented upon, and that Fazrahl’s plan is continuing to advance. They wanted us to collect the holy relic shield for them, and the orb is an Astral Orb that leads to another plane holding one of the other artefacts the Dawn is seeking.
Journal entries
Entry 101:
My journey with the Celestine Dawn begins. Lord Fazrahl sees potential in my unique skills. Finally, my talents will be recognized. These fools at the guild never understood the brilliance of combining different life forms. They will soon see.
Entry 112:
The first successful hybrid is complete. A blend of orc and troll. Its strength is unparalleled, though its mind is simple. More experimentation is needed to perfect the balance of power and control. The laboratory in the mountains provides the perfect secluded environment for my work.
Entry 133:
Some of the captives that escaped on their way to Garrush have been interfering with Lord Fazrahl's great plan. We shall have to keep our eye on them lest they become problematic.
Entry 156:
The Celestine Dawn has provided ample resources for my research. Captured villagers make excellent test subjects. Their screams are a small price to pay for progress. Each failed experiment brings me closer to perfection. Lord Fazrahl grows stronger, and so do my creations.
Entry 185:
Lord Fazrahl forbids me to unleash my creations on the meddlers who disrupted our operation in Verbobonc, despite them killing Garrush. At least they did not manage to prevent the ritual. Perhaps I should thank them for removing my competition. Whatever happens, I must trust in his plan.
Entry 216:
The time is approaching for the dawn of our new age. No longer will we be mere pawns among the filth of the planes. Those fools have fallen straight into the trap of retrieving the holy relic Gon'Thalor for us. Now we just have to retrieve it along with the other 2 artifacts. Once I have decimated them I shall use the astral orb Lord Fazrahl left for me to retrieve Amal'Atsar, The Binder of Wills. I just have to figure out a way to control the volatile energies of the other plane...
Entry 233:
Final preparations are underway, and I have my most recent and powerful creations ready. Lord Fazrahl's plan hinges on this. Failure is not an option. The so called Heroes of Verbobonc will fall, and my experiments will prove their worth.
With night beginning to draw in, we decide to make out way back to the inn and rest, but first we stop by the adventurer’s guild to see Eldric and ask if he has any tools that could help stabilise the orb. He says it should be stable enough as long as we don’t drop it, which of course he does, though thankfully nothing happens. He recommends that it should be safe to keep in a bag of holding, though he holds his breath as we put it in there.
We also stop by the market for spell components, since Eldric recommends “Old Skint” who deals in curios and would be able to supply a dragon token for Pyre’s draconic spirit-summoning spell. Pyre forks over 500gp for his icon, and Pamykos buys some Diamond powder for glyph of warding and some jade dust for magic mouth, at 230gp total.
With that, apparently we’re going drinking now, and Gideon decides the slums is the right place for it, for some reason.After Gideon and Zat taste the local selection of “Slop” and “Better Slop,” and we watch several fights and a spitting contest break out, we already regret the decision and make our way back to our lodgings at the manatee, where there’s a much better bar.
Gideon buys some risky whiskey for Zat which makes him invisible and inaudible for a bit. Okurak and Gideon have some too, with Gideon launching webs everywhere and Okurak’s hair turns bright pink. Pamykos is anxious to avoid a repeat of the last time this happened, and so shares a bottle of Elderflower wine with Pyre, who buys some suspect “Eldritch Wine” (brewed by Shamans) for Gideon, Zat, and Okurak to drink. Zat’s entire monetary wealth disappears up to the top of the nearest tall mountain. Gideon’s non-existent spellbook becomes the target of some crazed conjurers, and Okurak loses the ability to run without closing his eyes.
Pyre, drunk, orders a whole round of risky whisky, but Pamykos has kept his wits about him and declines, so Pyre drinks his one too. Chaos ensues. Pyre becomes very strong, but starts crying and snotting uncontrollably, so Pamykos cleans up with prestidigitation, finishes his glass, and goes to bed. Okurak creates a burst of psychic feedback that blasts Zat. Gideon summons a big grasping vine that breaks the floor, getting the party cut off for the night, though Zat (who gained the ability to detect lies for a bit) wins some favour by fixing the floor.
The next morning, Pyre doesn’t connect very well with his berrykin but advances with Hokoki’s box. Pamykos doesn’t manage to deepen his connection with Reyk much.
It’s the day of the final arena battle, and despite the delay from the day before, there’s quite a turnout. As it turns out, our opponents are the other adventurers from the guild, including Jambaroni, the human bard who pranked Pamykos with the tattoo. The others are a wizard named Murrinflurp, a half-orc barbarian named Gronk, and a paladin cleric duo named Puzz and Guzz.
As the battle begins, Pamykos is out for vengeance on Jambaroni, hitting him with a full-power psychic lance. Gideon crosses weapons with Puzz the Paladin, and Pyre calls down a sunburst that burns and blinds the whole enemy party. Murrinflurp turns invisible and retreats, Gronk charges Okurak and Zat, but calls a lightning storm before wildshaping into a fire elemental and engulfing Guzz the cleric. Okurak banishes Gronk and Pamykos continues to debilitate Jambaroni’s mind. Pyre traps Jambaroni and Guzz in a storm sphere which Murrinflerp is unable to counter and blasts Jambaroni with a lightning bolt.

Battle continues. Murrinflerp reverses gravity, reappearing from invisibility. Puzz heals his party a little. Lance throws a guiding bolt at Puzz but the paladin’s armour absorbs it. Okurak’s call lightning is countered by Murrinflerp. Guzz casts guardian of faith below the floating Okurak, Lance, and Pamykos. Gideon dimension doors his way toward Murrinflerp. Pamykos mind whips the enemy party but Jambaroni traps Gideon and Lance in a force cage. Pyre hits Jambaroni and Murrinflerp with an ice storm, and Guzz with a bolt from the storm sphere, but the wizard retaliates with a sunburst, which blinds Pamykos and Pyre, though Lance and Okurak are protected in the cage.
Guzz summons a spiritual weapon and charges Gideon. In the bubble, Lance and Okurak power each other up. Pamykos manages to land some blind eldritch blasts on Jambaroni, breaking his concentration on the force cage, in which Okurak has been steadily pouring mayonnaise from his alchemy jug. Jambaroni afflicts Lance with synaptic static. Gideon wails on Murrinflerp with the flail, and Pyre flies out of the gravity field as he recovers from the sunburst, though this does cause the storm sphere to dissipate. Murrinflerp hits everyone except Gideon with chain lightning, though Lance avoids the worst of it.
Okurak gives the party a word of healing. Pamykos grazes Jambaroni with more eldritch blasts, but is power word: stunned in response. Gideon breaks Murrinflerp’s concentration on the reversed gravity field, but Okurak catches the party with featherfall, though Okurak and Lance are attacked by a spiritual guardian summoned by Guzz. Pyre’s chromatic orb is countered by Murrinflerp, who also summons an arcane hand to attack Lance. Gideon is under heavy attack from all sides, but lance rushes to his aid with an inspiring smite. Okurak dispels the arcane hand. Guzz heals Jambaroni.
Pamkyos tries to fold Jambaroni but fails, and Jambaroni tries to polymorph Pamykos and fails. Pyre hits the enemy bard with a chromatic orb and triggers a wild magic surge, releasing a revitalising aura. Murrinflerp casts a fireball at Pyre and Pamykos, though they evade the worst of it. Pyre gets knocked out of flight, though he is still influenced by featherfall. Lance lands a searing smite on Gronk and lights him ablaze, and Okurak blasts Jambaroni with call lightning. Guzz’s attempts to heal our enemies are in vain, and Pamykos fells Jambaroni with eldritch blast, though he revives thanks to Guzz’s regenerate spell. He tries again to polymorph Pamykos and fails.
Gideon continues to assault Murrinflerp with all his might before retreating with a misty step, allowing Pyre to catch the whole enemy side with a snowball swarm. Murrinflerp unleashes a desperate ice storm on everyone except Lance, who is then attacked by Gronk. Puzz death wards his wizard ally. Lance subjects Gronk to an onslaught of fiery strikes. Okurak unleashes a decisive lightning bolt that downs Guzz and severely wounds the rest, before downing Murrinflerp with a spiritual weapon. Pamykos strides over to the dying and regenerating Jambaroni and starts insulting him repeatedly with vicious mockery, aiming to trap him a cycle of death-by-insults for the next hour.
Puzz revives Guzz using lay on hands. Jambaroni revives again and casts a hypnotic pattern which enthralls Lance. Okurak fells Puzz with more lightning, and with that, we’ve won! We’re heralded by the announcer as the heroes of Verbobonc and the champions of the arena! With a few more good insults, some drawings upon the face, and some dumped mayonnaise (cheers Okurak) for Jambaroni (more like Jabroni), we head inside (with Zat bidding us farewell to return to his business), only to find an ambush from the town’s guards for hire and wizards, led by Dart!
Dart, who appears to have some coughing difficulties, gloats, pinning a wide and ludicrous array of charges upon us, read out by Kermit the Permit Hermit. We make them repeat the list a few times for fun, and then Dart has us arrested pending a trial for our many crimes! Pamykos tries to arrange an escape with the eversmoking bottle, but the waiting wizards gust it away and the guards knock us all out!

15/10/2024
We awake in a prison cell without any of our equipment, wearing only tattered rags. With us is a tortle and a goblin we don’t recognise. It’s night and we’re all chained together along one side of a wall. Next to the cell is a wizard from the arcanist’s elite, one of dart’s cronies who captured us. A passing guard captain from the Dragon’s Claw makes conversation with the wizard and we learn that he’s really bored guarding us and having to sustain an anti-magic field all night while the prison’s anti-magic systems are down.
We exchange introductions with our cellmates. The Tortle is Lance, cast out and imprisoned by his rich father, a paladin of Pelor, for winning horse races on luck alone without a shred of talent, now trying to win back some favour. The goblin is a pirate captain named Kadakadamatazan (??) who apparently was thrown in here for “honest piracy.”
After getting our bearings, we try and get the attention of the wizard guarding us, but he remains largely unperturbed even by an onslaught of insults and Pyre flinging his poop at him. We eventually grow tired and fall asleep for the night. The next morning, the wizard is gone but we can still feel the antimagic field. Two dodgy looking fellows come up to our cell and take Pyre away with a bag over his head and arms shackled behind his back.
In the other cell, the two guys introduce themselves as Gunt and Arnoz, two contractors for Dart, and they seem to have some of our stuff, most noticeably the hitting-healing club we bought from Jizrek, with which they begin to torture Pyre for information on our friends and contacts. He tries blaming Moryx, which doesn’t help. When he’s knocked out, they drag him back to the cells and swap him out for Okurak. They get nothing from him, and Kada is next, then Lance. Pamykos annoys them for a while but is eventually forced to give up someone. He chooses ex-governor Lorrus, who seems the safest bet since he’s fled town. Gideon also gets taken at some point.
Back in our cells later on, a guard brings us food and Lance finds a note hidden in his food. It’s from Garrett, telling us he’s hiding spell components in our food. Okurak finds a small pendant with a lightning bolt on it, recognising that it may be a holy symbol for his god. Kada finds some tattered pieces of fleece-like fabric. Pyre finds glass spheres. Night falls and the same arcanist comes, but he remains able to resist insults, along with Okurak’s shit this time.
The next morning, Pyre scoops up a dead cricket and a caterpillar cocoon from the cell floor. We are once again taken for interrogation. They don’t get much from us since we mostly just waste their time, though they were intrigued when Pamykos told them about the giant lady with the four breasts. Regardless they seem to be more frightened of Fazrahl than willing to know more.
Back in our cells, Pamykos finds another note in his food, and Lance finds some nutshells (component for Confusion) and some gooey bead that tastes of eggshells (sulphur for delayed blast fireball?). The note also says Garrett can help in two days when his shift comes. As we hurl insults at the wizard guard, Okurak is able to break his shackles by turning into a bear and swipe some needle-like pine leaves from the barred window into the cell before transforming back. The wizard summons some people to bind him in chains.
Another morning, another round of interrogations. We waste their time some more. Then we get another note from Garrett saying he’s found our equipment and will create a distraction tomorrow night. We think, as Okurak struggled to read this one.
Pamykos finds a small amount of makeup in his food (component for friends). Pyre finds a small shard of sunstone. He also inspects a pine needle he picked up, but he can’t discern much beyond it smelling like bear shit and something else (Okurak really should have washed his hands) and not being strong enough to pick a lock. Lance finds a tiny ball that smells like some kind of poo. Kada finds a chip of something that smells like rotten egg. Pamykos scoops some sand from the cell floor (component for catnap). Gideon was taken away again separately from the questioning, but this time he didn’t return.
The night continues to pass, as the wizard continues to receive insults. In our dreams of a scary figure (Fazrahl?) doing powerful and evil things such as interrogating a bunch of scholars and turning them into husks. Pyre, Pamykos, and Kada wake up screaming and pissing while the others are ok.
The interrogations start again but they mix up the order, Kadakadamatazan (?) going first. They offer him a deal to get some info from the rest of us in exchange for freedom. He tries to lie about agreeing to it but they don’t buy it. Pamykos is willing to share that they dodged the cult’s ambush by teleporting back from the underdark to somewhere in town, and Pyre elaborates under duress that it was a beach, but not more. Lance refuses the deal to sell us out. Okurak adds that it was the south beach, not understanding why it matters that they know.
A little more food is brought by later, and we recognise it’s Garrett! Pamykos finds a note in his food telling us to break out after the distraction and to go straight, left, and straight again. Garrett will keep his cover and meet us in that room. Lance found a forked twig, Okurak found a sprig of mistletoe and Pyre found a pouch that smells like vomit. Kada finds a lockpick!
At night, one candle after the wizard guard arrives, the sounds of combat and a plea for help for a hobbling square-jawed guard calls the wizard away, freeing us from the anti-magic field. Pyre uses the lockpick to unlock his chains, Okurak’s, and Lances. Lance then frees Kada and Kada frees Pamykos. Okurak grabs the guard through the door and puts his shitty hand over the guard’s mouth. Kada yoinks the keys so we can unlock the door. Pyre tries to put the guard to sleep and fails but Okurak is able to banish the guard. We bolt down the corridor and turn left into the next room.
The wizard guard, whose name is Varian, commands us to halt and begins to cast but Pamykos casts confusion on him. The confusion works but only for a few moments, and Varian does manage to activate a powerful magic sphere of some kind centred on himself. Kada charges into the field, not feeling any obvious change, and gets behind the wizard. Okurak hits Varian with a sacred flame but his spiritual weapon doesn’t work, and as Okurak closes the distance his banishment fades and the guard from before returns. Lance casts aid on all of us except Kada (who’s too far away). Pamykos attacks with eldritch blast and Pyre tries to close range and use poison spray but it fails to cast. Varian retaliates with fireball.
The other guard attacks Pamykos and Lance but cuts himself once. Kada starts biting Varian’s shins. Okurak turns into a bear and charges. Pamykos starts headbutting the guard next to him, but Varian stops time for a moment and hits us all with chain lightning.
29/10/2024
Combat continues. Kada notices a clattering behind him as some weapons are dropped into the hall! He grabs a scimitar and re-engages with a flurry of slashes at Varian. Okurak mauls the wizard also! Lance slashes the guard with his claws, and Pamykos headbutts the guard too. Pyre tries to hit Varian over the head with a table but fails. Varian retaliates with a bigby’s hand, but drops concentration on his anti-magic field! Lance heals Pamykos, who unleashes a psychic lance on the attacking guard. Pyre pelts Varian with a snowball swarm and picks up a sword and shield. Kada slashes Varian one last time and brings him down, and attacks the guard also. Okurak terrifies the guard with a roar and Lance smites him with claws aflame. Pamykos torments the guard’s mind with another psychic lance. The guard tries to run, taking another slash from Lance’s claws. Kada chases the guard down and leaps at him with the scimitar, burying it in the guard’s back for the killing blow.
Pyre hands the longsword and shield off to Pamykos. Kada swipes a 100g pouch from the guard. Varian had a spell scroll of wish and a pouch of 200g. The gold is shared amidst the group. Garrett’s distraction is still underway, and we see him arrive and unlock a gate, ferrying us into a room with our equipment. He tells us the other guards had been forbidden to go through our stuff, but he had a chance to search it, and to study the orb during the shift changes! He says it’s been resisting the anti-magic aura of this prison and is trying to break free of its shell. He tells us to knock him out, grab our stuff, and use it since it’s probably our only way out. We quickly pick up all of our stuff. We have no time to don our armour, it’s time to go. It seems that breaking the shell of the orb, which has become much more active, will unleash its teleportation magic. With no time to spare, Lance shatters it, and away we go.
After a harrowing travel experience, we find ourselves in the plane of Limbo, a realm of pure chaos. We can feel ourselves being pulled apart and merged into one being, so we need to try and unify our minds to become stable again. We become an ocean of shared experiences and consciousness, seeing each other’s deepest darkest memories, shames, and secrets. Pyre acts the way he does out of fear for the world and a deep sense of abandonment, Pamykos is filled with regret and trauma from being possessed by Moryx and feels he will never be done trying to make up for the awful things he was forced to do. Lance feels the immense weight and the shame of being exiled by his father, and Kada’s past abuse at the hands of an orc captain, which led him to become a feared and deadly pirate captain flow through our minds. Okurak…
Our merged form stabilises, allowing us to perceive and stabilise the area around us better. We see a Githzerai monk floating on a cube of energy. He floats over to us and greets us, amused to see a merged consciousness so helpless in limbo. His name is Zith’Rax, and he begins to guide us in the process of shaping the chaos of this plane to our advantage. We focus our minds and form chaos into a doorway. He asks us what our plan is with the door, and we visualise the word Amal’Atsar (the name of the second artefact). He says he can help us retrieve it, but we will need help to function here, and we will need to help him with something in return.
The monastery-city of he and his fellows has been under siege by a great force, constructs made from hardened essence of limbo as the balance in the plane has broken down, and if we help him he’ll get us to the legendary amulet. He also speculates that the amulet may be in part responsible. We ask how we could help in our current state, but he says that we have great potential here, and he can help stoke that into a powerful fire, an entity with the power of 5 souls as one.
We follow him through limbo, aided by his aura of stability. As his city comes into view, we bear witness to a marvel of mental discipline, though cracks are beginning to show as the willpower begins to strain. He leads us past meditation chambers and across bridges of thought into a training courtyard where we will undergo some trials, beginning with the unity trial. Together, we form a metallic cube from the unstable energies. Next, we try for an icosahedron (a d20), which we manage, though it’s a bit hazy, and the numbers on the dice melt into words and twist on the surface. We try for a clockwork frog that will leap away, but we end up with a plodding, melty thing that bursts.
Next we try for a seedling growing into a small tree, and with some help from Zith’Rax, we manage it! Zith’Rax congratulates us and moves us on to a deeper test - a combat training exercise in which we will fight as one. We begin with a target dummy, each thinking of an aspect to embody. After a couple of tries, some weird constructs attack through cracks in the courtyard walls, seeking out sources of order to attack, and we spring into action.
We manifest weapons such as Pamykos’ rapier or Kada’s longswords, and spells such as Pyre’s minute meteors. A wild magic surge from Pyre’s spells made us and some of the enemies invisible, but the constructs nonetheless attack us with tears in reality that we manage to resist. We continue to attack, eventually shattering one into a million pieces. This also causes the others to begin to fracture, so perhaps they’re linked. After a few more attacks we bring the last of the first wave of constructs down.
gmdnd.vercel.app/limbo - have used flame/rage and void/direction, also radiance, concentration.
19/11/2024
Defeating the first wave of constructs causes the larger construct outside the walls to begin to fracture into pieces and launch crystalline shards at the crystal spire keeping the monastery stable. The monks rush to maintain the crystal and Zith’Rax asks us to help defend the spire.
We attempt to conjure a barrier, but it was too weak to block the next shard, which drops pieces of it down to the ground and causes some nearby buildings to phase out out. Next, we redirect some of the energy from the next wave to repair the spire. Judging from the rate at which the colossus is destroying itself to attack the spire, it has another 6 waves. Then we counter-strike, turning some of the shards back on the colossus. We fail to counter the next strike or redirect the one after. We land another counter strike but fail to redirect another wave’s energy. We manage to redirect almost all of another wave, restoring some of the spire’s integrity. On our next counterattack, we fail completely, but then redirect another attack’s energy to repair the spire.
After one more conjured barrier and a counterattack, the colossus can no longer attack the spire, but has shed enough of its mass to pass through the city walls. The monks are busy maintaining the damaged spire and defending the rest of the town, so it falls to us to finish the colossus. Channelling our minds together to conjure different aspects, we begin with a flaming dash, trapping the colossus in a trail of fire as we lay into it with various attacks manifested from each of our selves. Eldritch blasts from Pamykos, burning hands from Pyre, longsword strikes from Khada, thunder waves from Okurak, and searing smites from Pyre.
The colossus retaliates by unleashing a field of distorted space to trap us and then trying to crush us with its arms, missing once and hitting the next. Our next aspect unleashes a veil of twilight, disorienting the colossus, but also triggers a wild magic surge, causing us to burst apart in an explosion, though we just about manage to reform. We evade two more swipes from the monster, but are hit by another wave of chaotic energy.
We shift aspects into a rage and unleash more attacks! Pamykos fires a burst of eldritch blasts for major damage, but the creature retaliates with a wave of shards. Lance launches a guiding bolt, Okurak heals the party, Khada lands a flurry of sword slashes, and Pyre unleashes a sunburst. The creature continues to shrink as it loses more and more mass, though it also continues to attack with another space distortion. We shift the aspect of our rage to be more directional, charging forward with a heavy blow. This releases more sharp shards, injuring us enough that Okurak’s presence almost shifts into bear-form, but he resists (+5 bear XP). Pamykos strikes with more eldritch blasts and the creature retaliates with a wave of energy. Lance cures some of our wounds, and Okurak offers us all a word of healing. One last attack from Khada shatters it into pieces, causing all of the other chaos seekers to collapse and the monks to erupt in celebration!
Do XP next time!
19/12/2024
The monks all express their deep gratitude for protecting their home. Zith’Rax tells us that we should rest, and that the monastery’s resources are at our disposal. However, he tells us that before we leave, the master of the monastery, Elder Kir’thax(?) has requested our presence. He rarely meets with outsiders, so this is an honour.
First, we check out the city’s marketplace. We first stop at a stall selling various magical armours, trinkets, and machines. Pyre arranges a discount, and expresses interest in an unusual cube with shifting symbols, which the merchant reveals is a Cube of Possibility, which allows the user to see two possible outcomes each day. Pyre purchases it for 350g (down from 500, or the 400 the merchant tried to offer it for!). There is also a chaos-touched compass that “points to what we desire mostly.”
It’s normally worth 1750g, and even with the discount as low as 900g, Pyre can’t afford it, but before we can discuss whether anyone else wants to lend Pyre the money or buy it for themselves, Jizrek suddenly shows up somehow and offers some of his classic wares, including some boots, an endless lunchbox, and a mystery bag.  Khada is interested in the bag, but uses the cube to observe the outcomes of reaching in there. He sees himself drawing either some playing cards or what looks like a health potion. He ends up buying the bag for 220g after we identify its functionality as a maybe-bag.
With a little more haggling (and borrowing 300g off of Pamykos), Pyre buys the compass for 800g. Khada also buys the boots for 53g, compared to Jizrek’s offering price of 100g, but when we identify them we learn that they randomise the direction you run in, but at double speed! You also can’t remove them for 24h after donning them. He keeps them for potential future use.
Pyre buys the lunchbox after getting a sample from it involving some singing shellfish, but we’re also not interested in an umbrella he offered that could sometimes block damage, but Pamykos buys a whistle with some wild magic properties for 65g. Lastly, Jizrek has a potion flask on offer for 100g. Attempts to haggle don’t seem to work this time, and we’re not certain, yet Pyre has us go for it when Jizrek offers for us to sample it. We end up feeling like if anyone were to try and follow us they’d find it difficult to do unseen as our awareness improves. Jizrek says it has a new effect every day, and Khada buys it.
Khada also contemplates buying some new swords from the previous merchant, but decides to wait until we’re on our way out of town. After cleaning the new whistle with prestidigitation, Pamykos gives it a blow, and we feel resistant to damage for a short while. Pyre boils some water and throws his shellfish from the box in it - they start screaming and don’t stop until the water cools, so Pyre leaves them behind, only coming back to reheat the water and start the screaming again, much to the annoyance of the townsfolk who are trying to get back to some peace and quiet.
We visit another shop and get a massage as a collective, which is weird. Pyre covers the 3g cost, which is odd because you’d think he wouldn’t have any money left. We do at least feel very relaxed and present in our collective body.
We then go to meet Kir’thax before we rest. We head to the central spire. As we enter the main part and are escorted to the meeting chamber. The Elder floats down to us. He says that nine generations of his forebears had awaited the coming of those who would seek the binder. He explains that three divine fragments were spread across the planes by the gods after they tore open the veil of the realms, one cast into chaos (limbo), one into darkness (the underdark), and one into the infernal flames (avernus or one of the other hells?). But a fourth splinter split away, possibly unknown to the gods. This was a spark of divine potential, which the Elder suggests had somehow found its way to Okurak amongst all of us (as the green gem he carries with him).
Paste from Protolyst:
"Ah... the merged ones," he says, his voice carrying the weight of ages. "I have been waiting. Nine generations of my line have kept watch for those who would seek the Binder.
"Would you hear the tale of what you seek? It was during the Time of Shifting Stars, when reality ran like water through our fingers. The gods themselves tore open the veil of our realms, and through that tear came three divine fragments: one cast into chaos where it would be balanced by the everlasting maelstrom, one thrust into the lightless depths where ancient kingdoms dwell in shadow, and one cast down into the infernal depths where even devils dare not tread. When the gods sundered their creation, such was the violence of their act that a single spark was cast off - an unintended fragment, a splinter of pure divine potential. Neither weapon nor tool, but something... between. The gods themselves may not know of its existence, for it was born of destruction rather than purpose. Like a key forged by the lock's own breaking, it holds the memory of what was once whole." He looks at you, peering deep into your collective souls with recognition - "Perhaps that is why it found its way to you, five-who-are-one, who understand both unity and division."
You have proven yourselves worthy defenders of Shra'kt'lor. The threads of destiny weave strangely here in Limbo, and I see much that was, is, and may yet be.The threads of fate have woven you five-who-are-one to my chamber, and the pattern speaks of questions that burn within. Three truths from the great beyond may I offer, three glimpses through chaos' veil. Choose wisely, for like water through cupped hands, once a truth flows, it cannot be gathered again. The pattern reveals.
The Elder continues, explaining that he gets glimpses through the chaos and can give us three answers to some questions in addition to telling us where the amulet (the divine fragment here in limbo) is, since that is already known to his tribe.
We ask him how we can get to the final piece that lies in the hells:
When asked about the final piece - "Ah, you seek the path to the final fragment..." his eyes shift to swirling pools of darkness "In the Nine Hells it dwells, yes, but not in the circles you might expect to tread. The Pit of Flame holds many secrets, but this one lies deeper still, in Nessus itself, where the Frozen Lord keeps his most precious treasures. But mark these words well - the path to it will not be found through force or fury. When ice burns and flames freeze, when betrayal and loyalty dance as one... there you will find what you seek. The pattern reveals."
We ask him what the artefacts can do together and how that can help us, learning that they possess the power to destroy a god and take their power.
Finally, we ask him what the best way for us to use the wish scroll we’ve acquired will be, and he tells us that he will meditate on the answer, and when we reach into the pool of limbo at some point in the future, we will hear his voice and learn the answer.
He then reaches to some of those within us. Firstly, he recognises that Khada’s goblin blades were forged by a mad goblin smith in ages past, who arrived in Limbo and embraced the chaos to make one blade, before studying the pockets of stability to make another. The elder connects these goblin blades with their true nature, transforming them and revealing ancient goblin runes, naming these blades as The Laughing Edge and The Steel Mind before returning them to our combined hands.
Then he reaches to Pyre, offering a slither of limbo itself to better shape his destiny. He gives Pyre a shimmering, shifting, chiming crystal. This will act as a conduit for wild magical surges. Studying it, Pyre learns that it is a piece of crystallised chaos called the probability prism that can unleash much more chaos if he wants it to.
Lastly, he tells us that to find the fragment we’re looking for here in Limbo we should head to Limbo’s gravitational centre and defeat the corrupted guardian who holds it. We will have the choice to make our fusion permanent or to separate as well. He then closes his eyes and goes back to meditating, and we are escorted out, so we go to rest.
The next “day,” we conduct our morning rituals where possible (Reyk is still on the material plane, but Pyre’s berrykin got merged with us), and Khada meditates with his new blades. Pamykos confirms that the deck of cards Khada drew from the maybe-bag was ordinary.
Having rested, we decide to head out of the city, stopping at the market to buy some healing potions on our way. As we leave the stability of the city, we find ourselves once again surrounded by chaos. We fail to reshape Limbo to our will and find ourselves swept into some water. Good thing we can hold our breath. On our second try, we manage to reshape limbo into a magic carpet, and opened our lunchbox to find a glowing, battered spider leg with a side of sourweed soup to tuck into. We head in the direction we were told to, until in the distance we begin to see energy crystallising until suddenly becoming a chamber of iridescent crystallised glass, and a djinni appears to talk to us. He offers us unhindered passage in exchange for at least one of our participation in an interchange of energies, undergoing transformations and enhancements (something lost, something gained). Pyre is the only volunteer (for now, check this next time). He experiences some visions, makes some choices, and trades 1 strength for 1 charisma. With the fair exchange made, the Djinni vanishes and the crystalline chamber collapses, so on we go.
11/02/2025
The journey through limbo continues as we make our way through the chaotic maelstrom, weathering and resisting the buffeting energies at first. Fragments of memory from all possible timelines wash over us, but we keep our path. As we get closer to our goal, we see two blurry entities struggling.
Getting closer, we see two blurred silhouettes, a human and a tiefling. They appear to be in the same state we were when we arrived! We greet them and ask them how they got here. It seems they were also after the artefact, and having taken out some orcs, they found another note from Fazrahl and another astral orb which brought them here.
With a little prompting from us as well as their own instincts, they merge together, and suddenly our merged form and theirs are magnetically pulled together, merging into one. We learn that they are Yrsa, a Tiefling Paladin of Tyr who chased the orc warband across the sword coast and got pulled into this adventure; and Kalmia, a thief/mercenary who is looking for her mentor who was taken by the orcs.
As one, we head on. The surrounding area becomes more turbulent and we attempt to shape a barrier from the nearby energies. We just about manage it, and our goal comes into view in the distance. One more wave of chaotic energies breaks us apart, and we lose time reforming. We keep our attention through another swirl of alternate timelines.
Finally, we reach the eye of the storm. There’s an ancient-looking door. All around us is a violent maelstrom, leaving the door as the only path. Pyre has us test it with some Brieholder, and Yrsa has us collect and eat it, causing rays to burst from our mouth. Pamykos reads the runes around the door, which are written in Celestial. There are two inscriptions, one large and one small.
"What was split asunder let none unite
Lest chaos reign and order's light
Be dimmed for good by evil's hand
Through time eternal here shall stand
A second smaller inscription sits underneath the main rune markings reading:
"When need outweighs the ancient law
And realms of light begin to fall
The path reveals its secret way
Through paths where chaos holds its sway"
Inside the door, we find ourselves in a mirrored chamber that seems too big for where we are. There are several paths to take, and on a whim we head left, into a hallway where our reflections glare at us. We try to continue going left and the mirrors emit psychic screams that hurt to hear. We turn around and go back to the intersection. Based on the poems from the door, we decide to try turning out the lights. Yrsa casts darkness and it reveals the path straight ahead is the way forward. The next room is crystalline, and our footsteps cause echoing musical chimes to emit from below. The resonance seems more harmonious from the right hand side by Pamykos’ ears, and after testing his Keytar out (which did make an awful echoing mess of noise, but also confirmed the correct path.
Heading down the next corridor and making a delightful harmony, we suddenly find that the next room is inverted, and we are standing on the ceiling. Kalmia and Khada lead an investigation and it seems that the swirling dust in the “right” (from our perspective being upside down) hand tunnel is less turbulent. We pass the next hall without issue, falling to the floor in the next chamber, which has new mirrors depicting scenes from our past. Studying the mirrors, we see that one of them is showing events exactly as they transpired, whereas the others seem slightly… off.
We head through the true one and find a chamber with halls full of ornate frames, the contents of which we cannot see. On a whim, we head left again, and we were right! Unfortunately, we find ourselves in a dark chamber full of unsettling whispers. The left passage sounds extra menacing, the middle one calls us brave, and the right passage was indistinct. We try the right passage and it turned scary quickly as the whispers become cruel and overwhelming. Middle passage it is.
This next chamber has only one way out - a shimmering mirror we can pass through. Traversing it, the maze falls away, and we find ourselves in an open space with 9 floating platforms amidst a chaotic storm. We leap from platform to platform, but when we reach the one in the middle, an eruption of chaos happens in one corner of the chamber, closing off an area of the room. It seems that when it subsides it’ll just pop up somewhere else. After a few more slightly tricky jumps, we make it to the other side, and the chaos recedes, leaving us on solid ground before a big doorway, behind which we can sense the guardian’s presence.
We head inside to see a massive spherical chamber with the guardian, a massive being of pure chaos, floating in the middle with the amulet we seek at the centre of its ever-shifting “body.” The guardian calls us out and the chamber begins to shift as reality tears and warps. We begin to float in a starlit void as crystals orbit around us and pulse with light and magnetic fields. Shaking off the tearing sensation, we enter battle!
Our aspect shifts to a protective aura. Kalmia fires her bow and has us push off from a crystal to attack. Pyre empowers our collective wisdom and draws some energy from a nearby crystal, but the guardian attacks with a chaos beam that causes Khada to phase in and out of this plane. Yrsa closes the gap and summons a spiritual weapon, and Pamykos looses some Eldritch blasts. Reality also shifts again, this time to a fiery realm with erupting lava geysers and floating platforms. Our aspect also shifts to release a burst of flame. Unfortunately, we take a tumble and fall in the lava. Pyre gets us out quickly, and manipulates Limbo’s energy to superheat Yrsa’s greatsword, who gets straight to smiting, as the guardian retaliates with slashing arms. Pamykos also gets in on the smiting game with a wrathful smite, but this guardian feels no fear, and the battle rages on.
18/02/2025
Battle continues. The guardian shifts into a light absorbing form, becoming difficult to see and unleashing tendrils that diminish the surrounding matter and regenerate the guardian’s essence. We also sense that the potency of all nearby magic seems to be reduced to zero! We shift our aspect to unleash another wave of flame and trigger a wild surge that infuses us with vigour while inflicting pain over time (extra chaotic vitality). The environment shifts again, this time to a realm of wind and lightning.
We wail on the guardian with our assorted weapons since magic is out for the time being, and the guardian retaliates, lashing out with its bladed arms, before transforming again into a system of interlocking plates and arms, creating a relatively stable zone around us. We feel our magic returning, but it forms a turret and fires on us. We shift our aspect, generating a veil of shadows for us to hide and strike from. Furthermore the lightning that was once present crystallises into reflective crystals. The crystals also shoot out blinding beams, but we are safe in our darkness. Yrsa unleashes a devastating smite that causes several of the interlocking pieces to drop off of the guardians main body. These fragments reform into smaller constructs and get up to attack us, winding up and rapidly spitting shards towards us.
Yrsa and Khada turn to one of the smaller constructs and dispatch it, his goblin sword unleashing a wild suge that summons illusory duplicates of us. The other smaller construct combines back into the main body. It fires once more with its turret before emitting a wave of energy and transforming again, into an even more chaotic form. We shift our aspect, charging our next melee attack with the rage of the void. The environment also shifts again to an undersea void with crushing darkness and bioluminescent creatures that fire spikes at us, but miss after destroying our last mirror image. Kalmia lunges forth with the void-infused rapier strike, piercing and disintegrating it. This reveals the amulet, which Okurak collects using the mage’s oven mitt. Reality around us stabilises (relatively), and a portal opens, with Master Zith’Rax stepping through it. He congratulates us on our success through strength and unity. He tells us that the amulet had long been a source of disorder here in limbo, and that if we focus on where we wish to go, we can return to our city. 
He also tells us about our wish spell.
"Before you depart, I must share what the pattern has revealed about your wish. The threads of fate show three paths your wish might take, each with its own promise... and price.
If you ask for mastery over your journey, the chaos parts to reveal a way through the planes... though such knowledge draws unwanted attention. Through this path, you would gain the power to traverse the planes at will, to sense the doorways between worlds, yet know that others would sense your passage in turn. The very fabric of reality would resist your passage, extracting a toll in pain with each crossing.

If you seek to fortify your essence, I see a way to strengthen your very being against overwhelming power... yet such protection comes at a cost to your vital force. This path would grant you remarkable resilience, even the ability to deny death itself, though your maximum vitality would be permanently diminished, and healing magics would struggle to mend your altered form.

"If you choose to strengthen your bonds, your unity would grow as the realms align... though such connection leaves you vulnerable. Your combined strength would become extraordinary, allowing you to aid each other with but a thought, and share your life force amongst yourselves. Yet this connection would bind you in other ways - forcing you to remain close, moving as one, and even your very souls would beat as one, sharing the same rhythm in battle which could work for or against you. Your enemies would also find ways to exploit these deepened connections."

The pattern shows these paths most clearly. But remember - a wish bends reality itself, and reality does not bend quietly."
Lastly, he tells us to be swift - a great evil gathers in our home plane. After taking a moment to analyse the amulet Amal’Atsar, Pamykos explains that it allows the wearer to always keep their concentration and resolve, and bolsters their concentration. Yrsa takes it for now, though Pyre may also be interested. Now that the other shield users who might want it are absent, Pamykos also decides to take the shield Gon’Thalor. With that sorted, we decide to warp home to Athkatla. We feel ourselves becoming individuals again, but our time in Limbo has also connected us intrinsically in some way.
As we arrive on the beach in the city’s riverside, we realise something is very wrong. Weeks seem to have passed, and Athkatla has become a nightmare. The new road that was being built on the beach around the city has become a ritual circle filled with dark magic, orcs patrol between piles of corpses and ruined houses.
Pamykos reaches out psychically to Reyk the raven, and the two are relieved to feel each other’s presence, though Reyk is very scared as well. The two exchange a rough sense of what they’ve each been through since they last met. The images from Reyk are blurred, but they tell the grim tale of Athkatla’s fall. The completed ritual circle allowed Fazrahl to absorb the souls of every innocent or powerful person in the entire city before the orcish armies swarmed in to take over.
We’re lucky not to have been noticed yet. We need somewhere safe to make camp until we figure out what’s next. Pamykos has Reyk scout the city for anywhere that might be safe. The Adventurer’s Guild is in ruins, but the slums are full of abandoned homes, their occupants having presumably moved into the homes of deceased nobles. Kalmia scouts ahead and we follow the safest route we can until we find an empty home, so we cram in and rest, setting up shifts.
We manage to sleep through the night, though the sounds we hear are disturbing. We wake to sketchy merchants advertising wares they have ripped from the dead, and panicked citizens selling false guard badges and patrol schedules. We take some time to plan our next moves. From Pamykos’ communications with Reyk it seems touch and go whether or not we can start any fights without things spiralling. We decide to try and sneak our way to the adventurer’s guild to check the ruins for anything useful. Moving past orc patrols and wandering Celestine Dawn cultists Kalmia overhears some wretches huddled in a ruined shop whispering about a new mad king who has taken over the square in highgarden, along with escape routes from the city.
At the Adventurer’s Guild, it seems that anything worth looting is long gone, and the building was burned down. We learn from Tobin the drug wizard (Tobin the Tokin’, perhaps?) that the mad king in the square in Highgarden is none other than Arfan, the gnome who was making doppelgangers for the celestine dawn. With no better ideas we decide to head for Highgarden, and Yrsa convinces Tobin to come with us for some reason.
Kalmia once again helps us sneak our way around as we cut past the government and temple districts on our way to highgarden. The temples have all been desecrated and the government district is supremely well-guarded.
 As if by a miracle, we see Gideon and Rownar motion us over from a building. Gideon, who still seems a little shaken by his experiences after he was separated from us in the prison, tells us that Fazrahl visited him in his cell, and it seems Fazrahl was once a paladin from Gideon’s order of Pelor! Rownar also tells Okurak that the cult found the werebear camp, with a warband led by Okurak’s absentee mother attacking the tribe! Okurak decides to leave to go and help the tribe, giving us the green gemstone, and Gideon resolves to go and convince his Order of Pelor to help. They both promise to return if or when they can.
Rownar says there is little we or they can do to help here, and we should focus on getting the final artifact before Fazrahl can put his newfound power to use - but the exits of the city are not impeded so long as you don’t appear to be anyone of note or in opposition of the cult. We decide that while we can’t save the city and its people, we should still take down Arfan before we leave.
06/03/2025
Highgarden has been festooned with cult markings, and all of the plants are long withered and dead. Arfan has built a command platform in the square, along with a lab. He has several kidnapped nobles kneeling before him with vacant expressions. He’s giving a grandiose speech to a crowd of scared locals when he spots us. He declares he welcomes new specimens for his advanced experiments, and sets some of his experiments to attack us!
Arfan unleashes a cloud of poisonous gas from some vats surrounding his platform, but Khada charges into it to attack one of the experiments with reckless abandon. Kalmia also devastates the monster with a shot from her bow. Yrsa directs a very inebriated Tobin to sling a 6th-level fireball in Arfan’s direction - it hits two of the experiments as well as Khada, who thankfully dodges the worst of it. Arfan’s platform has some kind of shield dome that protects him, but some of the levitation emitters on the vehicle that keep it aloft are damaged in the blast.
Yrsa summons a celestial valkyrie spirit to aid us in battle, which he then directs to attack the levitation emitters on Arfan’s platform. Pyre adds his draconic spirit to the mix as well, and has it attack the platform’s barrier dome, but it glances off. The dragon spirit tries to retreat, but is grabbed by the second of two mechanical arms that shoot out from the platform. Pamykos releases some eldritch blasts at one of Arfan’s creations.
Arfan then releases syringes that empowers his creations into a frenzy. He also clears the poison gas, but has the acid vats shoot jets at Khada, Pamykos, and Yrsa. They dodge the worst of it but still catch some acid, and pools of it also form at their feet! Khada manages to push one experiment away to make space to maneuver around the other one and out of the acid. Tobin, stoned, tries to use Maximilien’s Earthen Grasp on Khada, but he’s too strong for it to grab him. Yrsa wails on the most injured experiment, and her celestial ally continues to strike the emitters, destroying one of them, though the others compensate for its failure and the platform remains aloft. Pyre twists reality, morphing the platform’s mechanical arm into a soft and fuzzy arm, freeing his draconic spirit, before releasing a snowball swarm on the creatures, decapitating one of them. The draconic spirit goes for one of the remaining emitters.
The remaining creatures are swarming Khada and Yrsa, the former of whom is very injured at this point. Pamykos blasts the nearest creature and gives a word of healing to Khada. Arfan then summons an exploding device, scattering Tobin, Kalmia, Pyre and Pamykos as they dive out of the way. He also shoots his creations with another syringe, which ends their frenzy but speeds them up. Khada lashes away at the creation, trigger two wild surges with his laughing edge sword, one of which places a curse of death on the creation, the other changing the local weather to storms to match his riled-up mood. Khalmia fires more arrows and Tobin fires a volley of magic missiles, which when combined with the curse of death from Khada’s laughing edge, brings down the second creation.
Yrsa battles with the third and final experiment, with the aid of the valkyrie. Pyre twists reality to partially weaken Arfan’s barrier, as Pamykos and the draconic spirit whittle away at the emitters. Arfan’s mechanical arms grab the valkyrie and the draconic spirit and begin moving them towards the acid vats. Arfan also releases a stream of poison gas from one of the vats towards Pyre and Kalmia. Khada also pounces on the last creature with a flurry of attacks, his Laughing Edge sword shifting reality so that he can taste colours and see flavours. Tobin’s earthen grasp reaches out and grabs the valkyrie which is currently being grabbed by the mechanical claw, holding it in place. Yrsa bolsters the vitality of herself, Khada, and Kalmia (with Aid) and the Valkyrie pries itself free from the mechanical arm. Pyre then envelopes Arfan’s platform in a 6th-level storm sphere! The shield dome still holds, but the emitters take heavy damage, one of them shattered. Pyre triggers a wild magic surge and polymorphs into one of the Celestine Dawn city guards that is blocking the exits to the square and stopping the crowd from leaving, gaining mechanical fists.
The platform still hovers, but is now only around 20 feet off of the ground, rather than the previous 30, so Pamykos casts Black Tentacles, which erupts from the ground below to grasp at the platform and the emitters. The final creature attacks Kalmia. Arfan calls forth the cyborg guards to attack us, projects a shield onto the final abomination, and releases a displacing shockwave to push us back. He also unleashes a beam of “ultimate power” onto one of the cyborg guards - its eyes are now aglow with power. Khada turns the last abomination into mincemeat, and Yrsa tells Tobin to chill before destroying the penultimate emitter with a javelin, leaving the platform to tilt down until one side of it touches the ground. She then moves to the other side to throw a javelin at the last emitter. The valkyrie attacks the shield dome, which doesn’t break it, but drains power from the emitters and the platform until the shield begins to flicker and fail.
Pyre’s storm sphere obliterates the last emitter. The platform drops to the ground, the shield dome disappearing. Pamykos and Pyre dispel the storm sphere, but Arfan uses Wall of Force to make a ball around himself and starts running away. Pamykos attempts to intercept him with a Psychic Lance, but Arfan counterspells. The two cyborg guards begin attacking, with the empowered one releasing some nasty eyebeams to expend his increased power. Another explosive device hits Kalmia, Pamykos, and Khada, the latter of which then charges the cyborg guards as Kalmia fires her bow at the guards for devastating damage!
Yrsa commands the valkyrie to attack the guards, and it caves in the skull of one guard with its mace. Pyre, still polymorphed into a copy of the other guard, begins beating it up. Pamykos hits Arfan with a stronger psychic lance despite Arfan’s attempts to counterspell. Now incapacitated, the wall of force Arfan was creating fails. Khada and Kalmia pelt the last guard with attacks, felling it.

17/04/2025
Khada charges the stunned Arfan, laying into him. Pamykos hurls vicious mockery, but Arfan retaliates with a lightning bolt that catches all of us, before commanding the vats from his lab to release an electrical field. Yrsa heals some of the damage away with a mass healing word and Kalmia fires her homing crossbow, the tracking bolt seeking out Arfan.
Arfan slams his staff down for a volley of empowered magic missiles, wounding us further, and Pamykos retaliates with more mockery, calling attention to Arfans wounds to name him “Duke Arfan the dying.” Arfan retaliates by making his vats detonate, and after a few more attacks, he teleports a short distance away before trying to run away. However, Kalmia chases him down and grapples him. He tries begging for his life, but after we decide we can’t trust him to not cause more trouble should we let him go and offer him a choice between death and some of Tobin’s strongest mind altering psychedelics, Arfan tells us to kill him if we must, since we can’t grasp the glory that the Celestine Dawn cult aim to bring to the world. As such, Khada kills him. Arfan drops his staff, which is an aspiring staff of Proclamation (a marvel of Arcane engineering), his syringe of action, an Orb of Eccentric Explosion MkII, and 3000G. (Also 12500 XP, which should have been added, but do check).
We also find his journal, with wild theories and technical diagrams on various advanced gadgets. Some of the journal entries are of note. #83 describes the aftermath of the first time we beat him. #87 describes the infiltration of the Athkatla city council and how they used each one’s replacement to enact their plans for the city. #96 describes the implementation of the city-wide festival plan, which included smuggling in many Arkonite crystals to house the souls of the ritual’s victims, and explains that Fazrahl himself has gone to Nessus to collect the final artifact, a sword that can momentarily disrupt any force and seize a god’s power. Arfan notes that should Fazrahl fail to return, he plans to take his master’s place on the throne.
With all of that seen to, we decide to leave the city and find a way to get to Nessus. Pamykos suggests going back to Verbobonc. Ratan helped us open a portal to the Hells last time, when we banished Moryx, so maybe he can help us again? Wearing clothes from Pamykos’ mage armoire, we manage to pass the city guards with no noticeable incident, and begin the journey.
It’ll take us a lot longer to reach Verbobonc on foot rather than by boat, which is how we travelled between the two cities last time. As it is, we make it to the outskirts of Purskull and camp for the night, but we likely will need to head into Purskull to look for transport.
The next morning, we head into town to find it the victim of several raids from the villains in Athkatla. We approach the least terrified/most welcoming person we can find. He’s very wary of us, but Pamykos manages to introduce us and explain what we need. He offers to take us to Verbobonc if we can escort him and his family. We agree, so he and his family gather their last few belongings, along with a few horses, loading up an open cart and hitting the road. Talking on the way, they learn that we are the heroes of Verbobonc, and Pamykos regales the family with stories of our past adventures (editing out the nasty bits). The journey is mercifully uneventful, and we approach Verbobonc to find it looking very much better than we left it.
The guards give us a heroes welcome, Arabella and Ratan rushing out to meet us as they hear the commotion. They’re delighted to see us, but having heard rumours from survivors of Athkatla, they wish it could be under better circumstances. We ask to talk with them somewhere more discrete, and once there Pamykos explains the whole situation. Ratan is most concerned with our news, but says he will help immediately, asking if we’re ready to go. We say we could use some healing supplies and anything else that will help.
He gives us 3 supreme healing potions, 5 superior healing potions, 1 greater invisibility potion, 10 fire resistance potions, and a scroll of Aura of Life, and Arabella bestows us with a greater version of the Bless spell, to help us upon our immediate arrival in Nessus. Ratan leads the way to a chamber where he assembles a ritual circle sigil and opens a portal. We thank Ratan and Arabella for all the help and say we’ll do our best.
We arrive near a massive chasm, acrid air and ominous sights meeting us. We immediately begin feeling the scorching heat of the ground beneath us, so we all drink one fire resistance potion each , granting us protection for the next hour. We’ve arrived on a summoning circle platform at the top of a long path that winds down. The path frequently erupts with lava and brimstone plumes from many fissures, though there are alcoves in the rocky canyon walls offering some cover. A whispering, crimson substance weeps from the walls, and winged fiends flit across the distant skies.
Reyk and the berrykin are not comfortable here either, but are spared the worst of the heat as they aren’t touching the ground, but regardless Pamykos uses prestidigitation to chill some bedding for our pets so they can be safer.
We make our way carefully down the path, but we encounter some chain devils. With few other options, we explain that we are tracking Lord Fazrahl who plans to steal an artifact from the realm. The demons don’t want that, so they’re willing to let us pass, but the leader of the trio says we must pay the protection fee by letting him taste the blood of the sweetest and best of us. By moral definition this would be either Yrsa or Pamykos, but we work out an alternative, with Pamykos offering a vial of dragon’s blood that Okurak gave us when we set off. The devil is very keen on this, taking it gladly and letting us pass. We ask a few more vague questions about the artifact and where we might look. He doesn’t know the artifact, but says that something that powerful would be with Lord Asmodeus himself. We ask the way, and he says mortals don’t normally just pop in, but we’re already headed the right way, and we might find more at Balzog’s Information Emporium at the infernal market along our way.
Carrying on, we reach the market. Heads turn, and several demons are eyeing us as new slaves. One small but aggressive imp blocks our path and demands another protection fee, but Pamykos pretends to be here on the orders of his former demonic companion Moryx the Doombringer, ordering the weakling to stand aside, which it does, frightened. Shortly after, we find the emporium. Balzog is a six-horned goat demon, who demands something of value in exchange for information. However, perhaps shockingly or perhaps obviously, Jizrek arrives at the emporium looking for his favourite customers! What is shocking is how he blasts away one of the guards who tries to grab him! We peruse his wares.
Khada and Kalmia buy a ring of borrowed time and a cloak of the fallen noble for a combined 65g. There’s also a holy symbol of turn (in both meanings of the word) undead (Pyre buys), a long-lasting (8hrs) elemental damage (of our choice) resistance potion with some kind of drawback (which Khada buys 2 of for 100g). Finally, there’s a sword of uncomfortable warmth. We bid Jizrek farewell, and he’s gone the next time we look that way.
We make our way to Balzog, and paying him with cheese (a slice of cheddar as a deposit, then a wheel after the rest of the info and our second and final vial of dragon blood, he tells us where to go and what to do.
He said Kavan’Tuvok is a celestial word and the only celestial thing in Nessus is the Vault of Entombed Light which no demon/devil can step foot upon.
To get there, you must first travel to the forgotten outpost where there is an inactive portal which you must activate. To activate it you need to clear the lava blockage in the NW tower to restart the forge, redirect the flow of lava to the correct channels, align the power crystals to match those of the star charts for the portal nexus you wish to travel to, obtain lava from the receptacles near the crystals and pour them onto the crystals to activate them.
08/05/2025
Still in the infernal market, we look at a map on one wall. The forgotten outpost is further down the path. The portal nexus we’ll travel to from there is south of the harvesting fields, which we’ll have to cross northward to reach the vault.
We take a moment for Pyre to apply some demonic disguises to our party (minus Yrsa), and then decide to do a little more shopping before we continue on. There are merchants selling potions, others selling imps, quasits, puppeteer parasites, abyssal chickens, and more.
Pyre has a test run whipping an abyssal chicken for kicks, and ends up needing to purchase it since he damaged it in the process. Pyre is kicking it along in an effort to stay in character, which causes it to bite Pamykos! Pyre then trades the chicken (and one of Pamykos’ pained tears) for a vial of bottled agony, and Pamykos buys a bottle of crystallised hope. With that, we move on. Pamykos re-analyses Khada’s elemental resistance potions that he bought from Jizrek. They grant 8 hrs of resistance to one element, but also to healing and other positive magic. The heat outside the market is overwhelming and our first dose of potions has worn off, so we (aside from Pyre and Yrsa, who are resistant enough to shrug it off) drink 3 more of our stock of fire resistance potions (4 left).
Continuing down the path, Yrsa investigates the alcoves, where she begins to feel hallucinations creeping in but resists it. She realises that the crimson substance seeping down the walls is whispering secretively, and also spots a vial in the alcove. Pamykos identifies it as some kind of resistance potion, but it’s not clear what kind. Yrsa sniffs the wall fluid, finding it pungent, and then listens to its whispering. The whispers invade her mind and cause fear, pain and weakness. We decide curiosity is more likely to be punished than rewarded here, and press on, stealthily and carefully.
Kalmia spots something on the path that Pamykos recognises from his studies as a Contract Stone, which will grant several hours of fire resistance in exchange for cold vulnerability. To preserve our stock of potions, those of us who would need the potions decide to take the bargain, and we move on. Kalmia then hears the rattling of more approaching chain devils, so we duck into cover to hide as they come past. Yrsa is struggling to hide, but Kalmia hides her with her cloak.
The next obstacle is some particularly furious geysers erupting fire from the ground of the path. The cliff walls on either side are steeply inclined, and we don’t seem to be able to determine the pattern. Pamykos uses his goat legs to scale the inclined wall and walk across. Yrsa climbs after them, carefully avoiding the wall fluid. Pyre, Kalmia, and Khada find a section that seems to erupt a little less frequently and make a run for it, luckily avoiding getting singed. With that we arrive at the forgotten outpost, where there are no obvious signs of life.
Heading in with Yrsa and Pamykos leading the way, we find ourselves in a large chamber that feels unnaturally cold compared to the outside. A ruined teleportation circle lines the middle of the chamber. In front of us lie the crystals, and the other corners of the buildings have the forge and the other portal elements we need to repair or activate to get the portal running.
Exploring, the first room we find looks like an old armory. There’s an impressive looking axe on a pedestal just past 4 suits of armor. Pyre looks for traps and sees nothing, and Yrsa goes to investigate the suits of armor, immediately setting off a poison dart trap. Yrsa spots the remaining pressure plates, warning the others, and then inspects the armor, noticing a complete lack of any gaps. She also detects magic and gets a bad feeling, suggesting that we leave the room unmolested. Pamykos is reminded by the demonic axe of Moryx’s flail and agrees most eagerly.
The next room we find looks like some kind of Warden’s quarters, with a row of cells lining the south. Pyre spots tripwires in the room’s doors, connected to a blade that would slice from wall to wall, which Kalmia disarms with ease. Kalmia spies a safe, but fails to notice the trap on it, releasing a poison mist cloud into the room. Inside the safe are the star charts we need as well as the warden’s journal. The journal describes the procedures to align the crystals, and also defines a password to disable the animated armor in the armory - “Asmodeus Ascendant.” Further entries describe the need to for maintenance in a hostile environment, how the forge works and how the lava powers the crystals, and how the outpost fell around 20 years ago in a conflict between demonic factions.
The cells are mostly empty, but for some scratching sounds. Yrsa demands to know who is there, and a little voice answers. It’s a Kobold named Pizrik(?) who was brought here by his nasty demon master Balbog (Ballbag?), before escaping, and accidentally locked himself in here while searching for rats to eat. He promises to be a good friend to us if we free him, but when we free him he tries to flee, forcing Kalmia to grab him and Pamykos to charm him to calm him down. He offers to show us around and help us dodge traps, including in the armory room.
Yrsa disables the armour and we approach the axe, cautiously observing it. Pamykos struggles to analyse it, but the eyes of its demonic visage blink and its maw opens, demanding that we feed it blood. We scheme to destroy the weapon once the lava flow to the forge is working, so we back away for now.
Pyre clambers up a wall near the forge to get within range, then uses Mold Earth to unblock the lava flow, getting the fuel for the forge going. Yrsa casts death ward on Pamykos, and they go and look in the forge. We identify the channels that need to be opened from the warden’s journal. Pamykos uses his telekinesis to levitate the demonic axe and drop it in the lava, destroying it.
Pamykos then reads the instructions on opening the channels from the journal as Yrsa and Pizrik work the levers, but he makes a mistake twice in a row, sending the lava in the wrong direction and endangering Yrsa and Pizrik! Pamykos surmises that the journal is written in a very peculiar dialect. Pyre takes the book and gets it right this time, and the lava flows the right way.
The charm also wears off from Pizrik, who feels betrayed, but after we explain the situation to him he asks if we can still be friends, to which we (some of us cautiously) agree. It’s time to align the crystals and pour on the lava, but the lava has not yet filled the channels, and Kalmia can hear many small feet approaching. Our efforts must have drawn some attention. Pyre hears the voice of Mephistopheles in his mind, harking back to that time he drew from the deck of many things and made an enemy of the archfiend. Mephistopheles has sent a horde of his lesser minions to greet Pyre. Looking outside the door, it seems that a horde of tiny demons is on the way! They’ll probably arrive about as the lava gets where it needs to.
Pamykos interprets the star charts and the crystal-alignment instructions from the journal, relaying them to Kalmia as she gets the crystals into place. Once the horde is in range, Pyre releases a sunburst, wiping out 4/5ths of them and blinding the rest for a minute. After a few attempts, Yrsa manages to pour the lava and the portal pulses open. She then scoops Pizrik (who is worried at the prospect of going to the harvesting fields) up and we run for the portal.
On the other side, we meet an aged demon who demands payment for passage through the portal nexus. Thankfully, he takes a wheel of cheddar as payment! We exit the portal nexus and pass into the harvesting fields.
We contemplate different means of sneaking across, but Yrsa questions why we don’t just walk across and cut down anything in our way, so off we go. None of the subjugated field worker demons bother us, but an overseer yells at us, demanding to know what we’re doing. Yrsa tries yelling back with thaumaturgy for the overseer to mind his own business, but it doesn’t work and we’re attacked as the demon draws two scimitars and lunges for us. Pamykos retaliates with eldritch blasts as well as inspiring Yrsa, who charges forth with her greatsword. After a few slashes, the demon tries to flee, yelling to raise the alarm, but Yrsa cuts him down.
Before anyone else can engage us, we retreat into stealth. Pyre and Yrsa use invisibility potions and Kalmia and Pamykos sneak along. In a short while, we find ourselves at the Celestial-designed vault. The doors have been busted open by corrupted tendrils matching those we saw in the ruined Athkatla, presumably Fazrahl’s work. Those same tendrils run along the hall before us down to a doorway at the end.
While prepping for the combat with some spell casts (and Pamykos drinking the crystallised hope), Pyre unleashes several wild surges and turns into an ancient gold dragon for 18 seconds, opens a portal to the ethereal plane for 24 seconds, and more.
We gain 8500 XP and level up to Lv17.
22/05/2025
One of the celestial scripts on the vault door describes a ward that has clearly been broken. Another states that “here lies what cannot be destroyed, only guarded,” and that the light always shines in the dark. Stepping inside, we find it much cooler than the outdoors of Nessus. Pamykos studies the tendrils, recognising them as Fazrahl’s work from Athkatla. These tendrils will spread and leech the life from anything they touch over time.
Yrsa summons a celestial valkyrie to support us in the (presumably) coming battle. Kalmia notices no traps, so we proceed down a hallway full of angelic statues that the tendrils are climbing at. We find ourselves in a library full of ancient tomes on the walls and clockwork mechanisms on the floor. There’s a grand door with an inscription, and another surrounding the central mechanism in the room. The gist is that we can find Kavan’Turok, Destroyer of Souls, if we prove our worth in insight, wisdom, and sacrifice.
Yrsa finds a journal from one of the guardians of this place. It describes how Fazrahl, once Fazrael, began his journey to evil after being denied ascension to the title of Pelor’s avatar. The fallen celestial slayed Pelor’s chosen and unleashed a dark ritual before disappearing. The journal also mentions that the artifact is sealed beneath this place’s hall of study.
Looking through the door, we find a chamber full of starlight and three more doors. A dais home to three beams of celestial light states that we must clear the three trials in order. First is sacrifice, which demands that we give up something of real worth, be it an item, or an aspect of ourselves. Yrsa and Pamykos sacrifice some vitality, while Kalmia sacrifices her deception proficiency, and Khada his persuasion skill. Pyre… . With this, we hear the mechanisms back in the study begin to turn.
The next door is wisdom, which bears some strange runes of the door plus an inscription stating that we must play dead to pass, though that last part seems to have been added by someone else. Yrsa tries casting feign death on Pamykos, but it doesn’t work. We try a few other things that don’t work, such as holding our breath, but investigating the runes gives us the answer. It’s musical! Pamykos plays DEAD on his keytar, and the door disappears, the mechanisms in the study turning further,
The final door for the trial of insight houses a statue surrounded by many weapons, and an inscription asking us to bring the weapon that is coveted by kings, ruins warriors, and ends all fights. Yrsa notices that one weapon bears a depiction of an olive branch. Peace ends all conflict, so we choose that one, and we’re correct! Returning to the study chamber, we find the mechanisms have been reconfigured to present a button, which opens a spiral staircase. Heading below we find a hall with just one door, and begin to feel a sense of dread and foreboding. There are no clear signs of traps, so on we press.
Fazrahl awaits, wielding Kavan’Turok in his hand, having claimed it from the gem encrusted pedestal on the far side of the room. Naturally, he wanted us to bring him the other artifacts. We brace for combat, but he freezes time. All at once, a wall of fire springs up between us and Fazrahl, an orb of magic explodes in our midst, and two meteors bombard us. Pyre is already down and the rest of us are on our last legs already!
We retaliate with what attacks we can, but he wields a power that makes our attacks only do minimal damage, and he summons corrupted tendrils that ensnare Pyre and Khada, though Khada breaks free with great effort. Khada then cuts free the unconscious Pyre. An enraged Fazrahl uses Kavan’Turok to drain our souls, instantly killing Pamykos, Yrsa, and the unconscious Pyre. The others decide the best course of action is to grab our collected artifacts and run, but Fazrahl quickly catches up and dispatches them both.
We suddenly become aware again, but all is dark. We have no self, but we experience the universe, seeing visions of Fazrahl going back to Athkatla, conducting another dark ritual to combine the artifacts into Guth’Bani, the god slayer, that tears a hole in reality to enter the celestial realm and slay Pelor, stealing his essence and power. The whole of the forgotten realms fall dark as the sunlight ceases. The artifact disintegrates, its purpose fulfilled, but Fazrahl has achieved divinity. He descends to reside with other infernal, abyssal gods like him. We slowly begin to become aware of ourselves again as our bodies resolidify. We awaken, and before us stands none other than Jizrek.
He explains to us that this is our final meeting with him. He is in fact the long lost and almost forgotten god of Gnoblins, who goes where he is needed. He has long been testing our worth to see if we should receive his power, and that, along with some items, is his final gift to us. He touches us and fills us with incredible power, which he claims will only grow over time, since we have been made lesser demigods! Though this visibly weakens him to his brink. He tells us to seek the gods in the celestial realm, gain their blessings, and challenge Fazrahl one last time. He then opens his pack and bestows upon us some powerful items specifically for each of us. Pamykos assures Jizrek that he will not be forgotten again. With that, he dissipates into mist and fades away.
We awaken in the celestial room of the vault, where the three trial doors are, and the dais in the middle seems to be home to something familiar that wishes to reassimilate with us. Reaching out to touch it, we regain that which we sacrificed for that trial! Furthermore, our new divine power has strengthened us in ways we can scarcely imagine.
29/05/2025
We need to get to the celestial plane to consult the gods. Thankfully, we remember that Zir’Thax, the master of the Gith’Zerai monastery in Limbo, told us that if we use our wish scroll to wish for mastery over our journey, chaos will part and reveal to us pathways between the plains (albeit at the cost of pain as the fabric of reality resists our passage, and that we may draw unwanted attention), Pyre makes the wish for us, and we gain a new power. We can sense that the boundaries between planes are weaker in a sanctified place such as this, and with a short search we find a path that we can traverse if we focus on where we wish to go.
Pamykos recalls that there is a lower celestial plane that, while the gods do not reside there directly, holds links to each of the gods’ celestial palaces. That seems like a good place to start. The passage is painful, but we arrive relatively unscathed. We’re halted by a celestial of some kind that demands to know why we mortals dare to approach the celestial planes. We explain that we seek to bring justice upon the one who slayed Pelor, and we seek blessings from the gods to grant us the power to make it happen. The celestial, whose name is Azlaman, is surprised to note that we have some aspect of divine power about us that is still unfurling, though we remain mortal. He says the gods may be willing to meet us, but he shall have to ask. He departs to go and do that.
As we wait, Pyre orders some food from a celestial attendant, receiving some soup, and ponders what has become of the places we’ve been in the pools of reflection that are nearby. We join him and get glimpses of Hommlet, Verbobonc, Athkatla, Pyre’s home, and Pamykos’ home plane of Theros. Hommlet is more-or-less all right, being far from the danger. Verbobonc has raised its defenses, having been attacked a bit. Athkatla has been turned into a stronghold for the Celestine Dawn, with a dark cathedral having been raised in the centre of the city. A few paladins and druids are massing outside in the woods.
Eventually, Azlaman returns, and explains that a few of the gods are willing to meet us: Tyr, Gond, Mystra, Helm, and Eldath. However, we will only be allowed to visit one, for the time being. We choose Tyr, since his goals of justice would align most closely with our quest, and Yrsa, as a follower of Tyr, could not bear to miss out on this chance. We also promise Pyre that we’ll ask Tyr to bid more of the gods to meet us, so that Pyre can meet his god Gond.
Tyr tells us that to defeat Fazrael the Fallen One we need to weaken his power base. He will grant us his blessing if we venture into Athkatla and defeat his dark priestess, stopping the leylines from being corrupted. Furthermore, on our return there will be an opportunity to speak with one more of the gods, which will probably be Gond for Pyre’s sake.
With that, we return to Alzaman, who can transport us back to our plane, wherever we should go. We decide to travel to the druid and paladin war camp outside Athkatla, where we find Okurak and some werebears; Gideon and some paladins of Pelor; and mother Ayana and her druid circle. They are heatedly debating the plan of attack. The werebears and druids want a full-frontal assault, but the paladins want to send a strike team through the sewers to open the gate first.
We fill (somewhat briefly) everyone in on our situation and our main objective, volunteer to be the strike force, and establish a plan - to sneak in, open the main gate to let the army in, and then we will all cut a path to the cathedral together. As a signal, Yrsa will send up a fireball, and Pamykos leaves Reyk with Ayana to telepathically send a signal, since Pamykos can send the signal to Reyk and Ayana, as a druid, can read Reyk’s thoughts.
We enter the sewers and begin our approach, but we quickly run into Tantin the Tortle. Yrsa and Pyre buy rat kebabs in exchange for directions to the nearest sewer exit to the front gate. We also ask him about current events in the sewers, and he explains that a “scary orc and a scary demon” sometimes come down here and head for the north end of the sewers. Yrsa eats the rat kebab but is thankfully immune to disease, and Pyre gifts Tantin the celestial soup, which he rather likes but still decides to add rats.
We move on, but Kalmia hears footsteps and voices approaching. As they round the corner, we see some demonic-looking orcs, and we ambush them! Yrsa begins cutting them down with her new sword, Pyre unleashes some minute meteors to scorch several of them and Kalmia begins collecting footage for her MLG kill reel montage by multi-killing several orcs with a single arrow. Pamykos rings a charge with some rallying magic from his keytar, bolstering the others to rush in and hit the orcs for a little extra damage. It does not take long to bring the orcs down. They don’t hold much of worth, but they do have celestine dawn cult robes, which we take to aid our infiltration, clearing any obvious blood or damage away with mending/prestidigitation.
With that, we press on. Pamykos uses another Keytar spell, piano/forte, making our sounds half as quiet. We reach the sewer hatch and Kalmia quietly climbs up. The hatch isn’t locked, though people occasionally pass by. There don’t seem to be any normal citizens remaining, only cultists and their demonic orc soldiers. We make our way up and make for the gate, looking like we belong. We pass by a patrol, but aside from having to exchange greetings hailing Fazrahl’s greatness, they do not cause problems for us.
We ascend to the top of the wall, where the entrance to the gatehouse is, where two guards block our path. Kalmia initially tries to deceive them into believing that we are their shift change, but ends up intimidating them into leaving instead, sounding unexpectedly scary (nat 20!) for someone who usually prefers a sneakier approach. Yrsa and Pyre stand guard outside as Kalmia and Pamykos go inside, though Kalmia ends up swapping with Yrsa since we need her strength to open the gate. As the gate opens, Pamykos sends the signal via Reyk and then instructs the raven to be an eye in the sky. The guards on the city wall spring into action as our army of allies outside begins their charge. Reyk relays to Pamykos that the barracks north of the gate are mobilising, and that patrols are heading for the gate.
The battle for Athkatla has begun.
19/06/2025
Our forces are charging into the front gate as the enemy attempts to mobilise their defences, but three groups of four enemy corrupted celestial guards each have spotted us, and are advancing up the stairs of the city wall. Pamykos uses his keytar to unleash a thunderous scream that pushes the first group tumbling down the stairs before stepping back. The enemy regroups and reaches the top of the stairs.
Pyre uses Hokoki’s amulet to cast Ice Storm on all of the guards, and he quickens the spell so he may cast again. This strikes all of the enemies, but a wild surge reverses his gravity and sends him skyward, forcing him to use freedom of the winds as his second spell, instead of the storm sphere he was planning. Khada charges in with a flurry of sword attacks, slaying one celestial but also accidentally catching himself in the process. Kalmia duels some of the second group with her rapier before slipping through the fight to get some range. Yrsa fells the rest of the second group with her shiny new radiant soul greatsword. Kalmia, acting quickly, fells another celestial with a bolt through the head. Pamykos empowers his keytar with psionic energy and begins wrathfully smiting the third group. Khada fells another enemy before shoulder checking the last of that group off of the city wall, sending them plummeting to their doom. Pyre scorches the final group with burning hands before Yrsa slices them in half with her greatsword.
With our skirmish done, we can see that the battle raging below is quite evenly matched. A cleric is sent to the dark cathedral to alert the high priestess. Okurak spots us and says he will join us and that we must make for the cathedral. As we make our way past the battle lines, Pamykos uses his Keytar to unleash a Crescendo of Dextrerity, empowering our forces to fight and move faster. This hastens us on our race to the cathedral and helps turn the rest of the battle in favour of our forces.
As we enter the temple district and head for the sickly green glow of the dark cathedral, we make our preparations for battle with the priestess. Not long after, the spoon of warning begins to buzz and we hear footsteps. We ready some spells, and three savage looking orcs turn the corner. All three are enveloped in a sickly green aura of power. One is a wizard of some kind, and the other a warrior. Okurak’s face snarls in recognition at the lead orc, the high priestess and Okurak’s mother, the Demon of the Dale. She offers for Okurak to join her, but of course he’s not interested. He spits at her, disgusted at her for abandoning him and for being so evil. She vows to defeat us and teach Okurak a painful lesson.
Kalmia wastes no time, firing a bolt that rips through the high priestess’s shoulder, causing her to bellow in rage. Pyre follows up with a twinned firebolt at the priestess and her mage companion, and also unleashes a surge that he had stored previously in the prism of probability, which fires a random spread of 11 magic missiles. The demon of the dale retaliates with a wave of necrotic energy that strikes all of us except for Kalmia, though Pyre dodges the worst of it. She also tries to command Okurak to join him, but he resists. All three of the Demon and her companions resist Pamykos’ mind whip, and she retaliates by striking Yrsa, though she retaliates with a hellish rebuke. The warrior with a club is also able to cast things, as it turns out, and he casts Flamestrike, which Kalmia dodges and some of us resist. Khada lays into the Demon of the Dale with many slashes of his swords, nimbly dodging her retaliation, though the demon does dodge another shot from Kalmia. Yrsa heals everyone up with a mass healing word and restores herself with lay on hands.
The Demon of the Dale fails to counterspell Pyre’s sunburst. It blinds and scorches her, and would have done the same to the club-wielding warrior, but he seems to be totally immune to the spell. The mage resists the worst of the sunburst’s effects. Pyre continues to be hurt by casting so many spells after the wish, and a wild surge scatters all of us and the Demon with random teleportation! Despite being blind, she wails on Yrsa, having landed next to her, though she is then incapacitated by a psychic lance from Pamykos, though she seems to resist the worst of the damage. The orc mage then drains our life force and uses it to heal the Demon and the warrior-healer, though this spell seems to weaken the mage, so they probably can’t do this often.
Yrsa is brought down by this life drain, but Pamykos uses the Final Chord to restore her to consciousness and to blast the club-wielder and the mage. Everyone (except for Pamykos of course) has a bardic inspiration.
03/07/2025
Pamykos follows up on his final chord with a volley of eldritch blasts at the club-wielding healer, though only one hits. The club-wielder then unleashes a massive heal on herself and the demon of the dale. Khada retaliates with a flurry of slashes, one of which triggers a wild surge that stops time for everyone except for him and the enemy healer. The two then duel it out until time resumes. Khada triggers another wild surge that makes him grow in size and strength, but the healer prays to Lord Fazrahl to aid and is majorly healed again, though it seems to take something out of her. This 1v1 rages on for a couple more rounds, which includes a third wild surge, though this one permanently reduces Khada’s maximum HP by 1, rather than doing anything beneficial, though Khada’s Titan’s Grip Gauntlets also made his attacks blindingly strong, so the healer can’t see right now. The healer calls for one more heal from Fazrahl, though this one seems less effective. Time then unfreezes and Khada shrinks to normal size.
Kalmia strikes the demon of the dale with arrows and attempts to use her shadowy veil to sway the Demon to attack to her allies, though that doesn’t succeed. Yrsa provides a mass healing word to us all, followed by a lay on hands heal for herself. Unfortunately, the Demon of the Dale retaliates and knocks her unconscious again. She then runs to Pyre for one last attack, risking a attack of opportunity from Okurak, though it misses. Okurak gives chase after his mother and furiously mauls her. Pamykos calls the Demon of the Dale “The Demon of the Fail” in a vicious mockery, but she seems unperturbed. The enemy mage looses chain lightning at Pamykos, Khada, and Kalmia, though Pamykos dodges the worst of it and Kalmia dives out of the way. The healer cures her wounds once more, though this latest heal is rather weaker than her previous efforts.
Khada continues wailing on the healer with his swords, and uses the strength of his gauntlets to shatter the ground beneath the healer and the mage multiple times. The healer barely manages to remain standing, but the archmage is knocked prone. The mage, standing back up, launches two magical blasts each at Khada and Pamykos. Kalmia uses her tracking shots on the demon of the dale. Pyre escapes from close quarters combat with the demon by using freedom of the winds. The demon finally manages to exert some control over Okurak before running over to Pamykos and knocking him unconscious with several strikes. Thankfully, Okurak wrests control of his mind back from his mother, shifts back into human form, and then heals Pamykos, who then strikes the demon of the dale with his keytar.
Khada drinks a potion of supreme healing before attacking the healer some more. Kalmia finishes the healer off with two crossbow bolts, the first ripping away half of the enemies face, the second knocking what’s left of her head off. Pyre revives Yrsa with a potion of supreme healing from Yrsa’s kit, and then attacks the archmage with a fire bolt.
The demon of the dale knocks out Pamykos again, and then runs over to attack Khada, though Okurak gets another attack of opportunity in. Okurak revives Pamykos once more. Pamykos then casts a mind whip at the demon and the archmage, though the demon teleports away, so only the mage is affected. Khada brings the archmage down to his last gasps of strength. The demon hits Kalmia with a necrotic wave, though Pyre bends luck in her favour. The archmage offers some retaliation against Khada with two more magical blasts, but nothing deadly. Yrsa casts a max-level healing word before re-engaging the demon of the dale in melee combat with her greatsword. Kalmia slays the archmage with a headshot. Pyre misses with two twinned firebolts. The demon of the dale knocks Yrsa out again. Okurak revives Yrsa, but shifts into a werebear again in the stress of this combat.
Kalmia takes careful aim and fires a shot so perfect it creates a sonic boom on impact, shattering all of the nearby windows and immediately vaporises the demon of the dale’s head (172 damage!!!). Okurak drops to his knees in mourning by his mother’s corpse, though Pyre and Pamykos offer him some comfort. We also revive Yrsa, and level up! (Set XP to 270,000)
The battle for the city begins to come to an end and a chorus of cheers (of a heroic kind, not the demonic kind) rises up and heads in our direction. Some of the paladins and druids, including Ayana, reach us, declaring victory, and heal us all up. Together we resolve that we still need to cleanse the leylines and destroy the dark cathedral. As we make our way towards the entrance, however, we begin feeling more and more queasy as we bathe in the sickening green glow that emanates from the cathedral. Ayana begins preparing a ritual
Pyre contemplates whether or not a sunburst might cancel out this vile light with some better ones, and Pamykos speculates based on arcane knowledge that that might be a good train of thought, since this necrotic magic is coming from a source point somewhere inside the cathedral that we’ll need to affect to stop this aura. Pyre wades through the sickening light to the door. Investigating it reveals nothing, but it’s not locked. As he opens the door, a wave of necrotic energy washes over him, but he persists. Pyre can now see a shrine to Fazrahl inside holding a gemstone, so he tries his sunburst. The gem shatters in a massive wave of necrotic energy that hurts us all quite badly, but the healers in our army go to work. Ayana and the paladins are confident that they can handle cleansing the area and restoring balance to the other temples from this point.
Our war party has found a selection of extremely useful magical items that could help either with rebuilding the city or in our battles to come. We are offered first pick of one thing each, with the rest going to aid the repairs. {Insert our choices of items here}. The last thing on our to-do list before going to see Tyr is to restore the natural flow of energy. We all link arms and channel our shared divinity, pulling unlimited energy from the world to wash away all of the corruption.
10/07/2025
We bask in victory! Some of the locals recognise us as the heroes of Verbobonc, others decide we should be the saviours of Athkatla instead, but finally we are bestowed the title “The Chosen of the Realms.” We talk with the surviving city folk for a bit as some of the paladins and druids begin discussing rebuilding the city and setting up a new democratic system. Then we go shopping, selling some of our old, unused magical items to buy some new ones along with a large stock of healing potions.
We decide to go for a celebratory drink. Kalmia drinks some Eldritch Wine and ages 7 years. Pyre drinks some as well and starts disco dancing. He also orders some Mordenkainen’s risky whisky for Yrsa, Pamykos, and Khada, though Yrsa declines, so Kalmia takes her shot. Khada limbs are twisted into strange angles for a few days, Pamykos’ next damaging spell becomes a healing spell, so he eldritch blasts himself and gets up feeling even better! Kalmia’s shot grants her her own personal thundercloud and rainstorm for the next 3 days. The celebrations go on into the night.
The next day, Pyre sets to work on his new Golem, while the rest of us help out with the city’s recovery efforts. Khada helps move the bodies (and loots some coin purses from the dead orcs in the process). Pamykos motivates the repair crews with some morale-raising music (and earns a discount on some of the city’s shops). Kalmia entertains the children with sleight of hand close-up magic tricks, enabling their parents to work harder. Yrsa sadly is hung over and doesn’t manage to be much help with healing the wounded (I rolled a nat 1, sorry), so she spends the next few days praying to Tyr. Pyre also spends some time working with Hokoki’s box and playing with his berrykin, and Pamykos spends some nice time with Reyk, but isn’t able to deepen their psychic connection in full.
After a few days, once Pyre’s golem is complete, the time has come to move on. We bid a fond farewell and good luck to our friends and allies before we use our power to seek a pathway back to the lower celestial plane. The journey is as painful as ever, but we arrive otherwise unmolested. Alzaman the celestial is waiting for us. He notes that the realms are stirring from our successes, and takes us to see Tyr once more.
Tyr welcomes us back and exclaims that he has felt our actions shift the scales of balance. He says he has more he wants to discuss with us, that we should ideally have come back sooner for, but that can wait until after we have completed our second task. Regardless, Tyr gives us the blessing he promised.
We decide to meet with Mystra next. She tells us that we have chosen well. Fazrahl is unleashing corrupting magical threats throughout the realms, but the greatest of these is building in Waterdeep. She shows us that energies are building up in the heart of the city as Fazrahl aims to rip open a tear between planes and let a terrible entity through to the material plane. We will need to slay waves of monsters that are coming through the first small tears in reality from four different lower planes (including some of the hells and such). If we seize something of the essence of these creatures (anything physical will do), we can then connect our divine essence to that of each of the four planes, destabilising and severing the portal’s connection to each of the four planes. She also promises to discuss her thoughts on this incident in relation to Karsus’ folly, the previous time a god’s power was usurped, on our return. With that, she vanishes and Alzaman leads the way to a portal to Waterdeep.
31/07/25
The interplanar travel is as painful as ever. We arrive in Waterdeep to see three groups of wraiths have just arrived ahead of us and are flying around terrorising people. The rift created by Fazrahl has blasted away the stalls in the marketplace, flattening them and clearing a wide area. We go to work battling the wraiths. Yrsa charges in and slashes at the first group with her greatsword, summoning a spiritual weapon to fight alongside her. Kalmia uses her divine momentum to finish off that group and destroy the next one, as well! Pamykos and Pyre whittle away the next group into nothingness with eldritch blasts and fire bolts, plus some blows from Pyre’s golem, which Pyre overcharges with Tyr’s divine smite of justice.
As we celebrate our victory over the first wave, we see another rift circle begin to open. Pyre has his golem retrieve some rags from the remains of the wraiths for us to use to seal the portal. Pamykos surmises that if we cast the rags into the portal and at least two of us place our hands upon the portal rings we can pour our divine energy through and destabilise the first portal. Pyre and Pamykos do this, and with our powers combined, the first portal (which presumably lead to the shadowfell, judging by the wraiths) is closed. However, the second portal is opening. Pyre tries to surmise which plane it links to, but isn’t able to discern anything precise beyond that it links to one of the hells. We take up positions as the new portal opens and a mixed assortment of devils come through.
Yrsa begins attacking the first group, but Kalmia uses more of her divine momentum to instakill two whole groups again (rogue critical hits are an experience, 180 damage!!!)! Pamykos and Pyre begin slaying the devils in the final group with a psychic lance plus a blow from the keytar, and a fireball, respectively. Pyre’s golem unleashes poison breath on the last group as well, finishing off the last group. With that dealt with, Pyre and Pamykos scrape some devil goo from Yrsa’s face (splattered as a result of Kalmia’s sonic boom and toss it into the portal, communing with it to close it. However, a third portal opens and a horde of skeletons pour through.
Yrsa catches this wave with a flame strike but they all dodge the worst of it before charging us. Some go for Pamykos, but Yrsa is mobbed by three of the groups. Kalmia rains fire on the skeletons, and charms one of the groups to fight for us with her veil of shadows. Pyre unleashes a snowball swarm and some minute meteors on one of the other groups, and his golem attacks the other. Yrsa’s green flame blade dances across two of the groups, but they remain active. Kalmia slays a group with another critical hit (168 damage this time)! Pyre sets up a delayed blast fireball and has his golem keep attacking. Yrsa uses turn undead to scatter the skeletons, sending them running into the perimeter the town guard has created and allowing us to attack them more freely, at least for the moment. Pyre, Pamykos, and Kalmia dispatch the third group of skeletons, while the second group continues to flee and is attacked by Yrsa, her spiritual weapon, and Pyre’s golem. Pamykos finishes off the third group with a smite from Tyr, scoops up some bones, and runs over to the portal ring to close this particular rift, since the next one has begun opening!
Unfortunately, as Pyre fells the last skeleton, a massive clawed hand comes through the final portal, and a great demonic beast emerges with a mighty roar. It declares itself to be none other than the true form of Moryx the Doombringer! With all his full might, he aims to cleanse this city and then the rest of the realms, and he will take particular pleasure in consuming the soul of his former host, Pamykos. Pamykos declares that he knew this day would come, and while Moryx has grown stronger since they last met, Pamykos says that he has grown so far beyond Moryx.
Moryx steps on Pyre’s delayed blast fireball, but it has no effect on him thanks to his hellish resilience. Pamykos is caught in the blast, however, and left quite badly wounded. Thankfully, our heroes are quick to act. Pyre catches Moryx with Hold Monster, and we follow up with a massive amount of damage from Yrsa’s divine smite (with added Tyr’s smite) and some attacks from Pyre’s golem that all critically hit the paralysed dark lord.
As a legendary action, Moryx attempts to possess Pamykos, but Pamykos resists. Unfortunately, Moryx is strong enough to break out of hold monster early, and he unleashes a flaming roar that burns us all, knocking Pamykos unconscious. Pyre puts up a wall of force between most of us and Moryx, and then has his golem feed Pamykos a supreme healing potion. Moryx unleashes a powerful psychic gaze at Pyre, inflicting intense pain, but he manages to keep the wall up. Unfortunately, Moryx flies over the wall and lands on us, scattering us to the side. Yrsa retaliates with a divine smite, but two more skeletal horrors emerge from the portal, as we still haven’t been able to close it!
28/08/25
The battle continues. Yrsa/Okurak heals Pamykos, revitalising him to almost full health. The existing skeleton horrors try to run around the wall of force, but the final portal through which Moryx came does something strange, and all of us except for Pyre feel weary and unsteady. Moryx attempts to savage Pamykos with many attacks, which Pamykos dodges, but the doombringer unleashes a massive tail swipe that impales all of us except for Kalmia. She retaliates with a crossbow shot, though Moryx also attempts to rend Yrsa’s/Okurak’s soul. Yrsa/Okurak resists, but still feels great pain from it.
Pamykos issues a divine decree, denying the power of the doombringer and preventing him from harming us for a time, before afflicting the hexblade’s curse upon Moryx. Pyre hits Moryx with some magic missiles. Moryx then once again demands that Pamykos be his slave once more, flooding Pamykos’ mind with an overwhelming presence and taking control.
Moryx’s portal stops making us uneasy, but charges up for something. Everyone feels a force pulling us in before a blast is released, sending everyone flying except Pamykos, who resists. Pamykos, controlled by Moryx, hits Okurak/Yrsa with a full-strength psychic lance. He tries to break Moryx’s grip, but fails. Yrsa/Okurak heals everyone with mass healing word. Moryx stamps the ground and unleashes a wave of flames. Everyone continues to assault Moryx with whatever we can, including crossbow bolts from Kalmia, sword slashes from Pyre’s golem, and a storm sphere from Pyre, but he restrains several of us again with his tail.
Kalmia unleashes a devastating shot, empowered by Tyr’s smite of justice (214 damage crit!) against Moryx, breaking off a piece of one of the doombringer’s horns! Moryx forces Pamykos to kill several city guards with arms of hadar, but afterwards Pamykos wrests back control. Yrsa/Okurak lands some hits with her greatsword (+booming blade) and spiritual weapon, and restores us with another mass healing word. Some ghosts emerge through Moryx’s portal as he rends Pyre’s soul, dealing heavy damage. The skeletal horrors have also been attacking Pyre, but he’s standing strong.
Pyre stops time, empowers himself with his divine form and unleashes a lightning bolt that nearly wipes out the ghosts and skeletal horrors. Moryx tries and fails to possess Pamykos again before charging enraged toward his former slave. Moryx fails to bite Pamykos, and the satyr also dodges his tail sweep. The sweep also wipes out the ghosts, but it does hit Yrsa and Pyre’s golem. Kalmia lands another devastating shot on the doombringer before dodging an arcane bolt released toward her by the portal.
Pamykos, informed of the dropped piece of Moryx’s horn by Okurak, runs to grab it, signals for someone to move near the portal and to be ready, and then casts Etherealness, vanishing into the border ethereal and moving toward the portal’s location.
Okurak/Yrsa uses Destructive Wave with a channel divinity to blast Moryx and to completely wipe out all of the skeletal horrors. Pyre moves toward the portal to prepare for Pamykos’ return. Moryx intercepts and misses with a bite attack, but rends Pyre’s soul, ripping them out of their divine form! Pamykos re-emerges from the border ethereal and returns Moryx’s horn through the portal. Yrsa/Okurak uses mass heal to restore all of us to full health, as well as any injured guards and civilians that are nearby! They also strike Moryx with the spiritual weapon. Moryx sweeps his tail, catching Pyre, the golem, and Okurak/Yrsa, though Pamykos dodges. Pyre and Pamykos succeed in closing the final portal!
Moryx spreads his wings wide, oozing acidic infernal ichor everywhere, before sweeping the wings around, battering Pyre, Pamykos, the golem, and Yrsa/Okurak. Kalmia lands another 134 damage shot! Pamykos abjures Moryx with a psychic lance (though the doombringer resists its effects) before flying up to get clear of the acidic ichor. Pyre hits Moryx with hold monster (knowing it will likely only last a turn) and a chromatic orb of lightning (courtesy of divine alacrity), though Moryx seems resistant to lightning.

Kalmia continues to pepper Moryx with bolts from her crossbow. Pamykos mocks Moryx, stating that all his power amounts to nothing before swinging his keytar. The mockery doesn’t do much, but the keytar strike had an impact. The Doombringer, having broken free of Hold Monster, sweeps his tail twice, catching Pyre, Khada, and the golem twice and catching the airborne Pamykos with the second swipe. Impaled on the giant demon’s tail, Pyre enters his divine form and drinks a healing potion. His golem hacks away at Moryx’s tail with its sword. Khada swings his goblin scimitars wildly and slices off his tail. Black gore spews everywhere, and Moryx explodes in a shower of gore that coats the surrounding area. In the aftermath, a tiny, squealing, squirming thing is all that remains. Pyre and Pamykos destroy it with fire and eldritch blasts, and finally Moryx is gone.
Some royal guards turn up, heralding the arrival of the king of Waterdeep himself! He hails us great heroes and saviours of waterdeep and the wider world, promising anointment and ascension to legends upon our return to waterdeep once we have completed our divine purpose. Some of the city guards who witnessed the fight (and particularly the deaths of some of the guards that Pamykos caused while under Moryx’s control) seem apprehensive of us, but we assure them it was not our intention, and that their loss will be honoured. Pyre scoops up the remains of Moryx into a jar (for Okurak?!?), and with our business here concluded, we decide to planeswalk back to Mystra’s domain.
Returning to the divine realm, Alzaman greets us on our arrival and says Tyr has called for a meeting with us. As such, we go along to meet Tyr once more. He is impressed! He explains that our power has continued to grow, but he requires Yrsa’s aid to defend the celestial realms themselves from Fazrahl’s influence by protecting the vault of infinite light (was that right?). Yrsa agrees, and she parts ways from us. Tyr then explains that the dawnfather’s stolen power has not yet settled into Fazrahl, so our actions to weaken his spiritual power base has left him relatively vulnerable. We need to go to the grey wastes of Hades to finish this fight once and for all. He offers us a truth about justice that we may need to cling to in order to keep our wills intact in that place. Then he bids us good fortune and leaves.
Next comes Mystra, who is also pleased with our success. She answers Pamykos’ questions about how these events relate to the Folly of Karsus in aeons past. She explains the Ao himself is currently away dealing with the fallout upon reality from Fazrahl’s actions, and he can only return to put things right once Fazrahl is gone. However, she also surmises that Pelor can not return as Mystra once did, though the power that was ripped from him will remain once Fazrahl is gone, and Ao will likely then sort things out one way or another. She rewards us with one more final infusion of divine power, filling us with overflowing arcane power and knowledge. This expands our magical abilities and enhances our understanding of the arcane. It also unlocks the fullest potential of Pyre’s berrykin and Hokoki’s amulet, and it fully opens and expands the connection between Pamykos and Reyk the Raven, unlocking new abilities that the two of them together could not unlock before.
This is our last chance to see to any outstanding tasks and set our affairs in order before we face Fazrahl, and we sense that we have some time to spare as long as we don’t dawdle. We decide to check in on Verbobonc and awaken Old Bum, since last time we were there we were so busy rushing to Nessus we forgot! We planeswalk to Verbobonc, and are welcomed like the heroes we’ve become. However, within the gate, we’re beckoned over by none other than Elderon, the time traveller we met all those years ago. Turns out he’s actually the 843rd Elderon, who tells a very long rambling story about time travel and making changes to the timeline, how sometimes we become villains, sometimes we die, sometimes we delay Fazrahl, but we’re yet to succeed. Though this time could be different. He doesn’t have much directly useful information, other than that we should help an old friend if we find one in the grey wastes of Hades. Moving on, we find a statue of us all, with an engraved plague featuring the names of the fallen from the battle of Verbobonc, including old bum. Pyre buys a bouquet of flowers to lay at the statue’s feet. Arabella finds us at the statue and bids us an excited welcome, astonished to see we have been touched by the divine as well!
She takes us to see Old Bum and Ratan, who has been visiting the gnome every day to try and find a cure. Ratan is just as amazed to see us, and when we present the potion, Ratan explains he’s learned of some complications - the potion must be administered at sunset and while the patient’s true name is spoken. Thankfully, between our psychic connection and our divine power, we’re able to reach into Old Bum’s mind, learning his true name is Turnips Mcgee! We revive him by using a driftglobe to create an artificial sunset. It works, and he’s delighted to see us, and tells us he met Chauntea in his coma, who told him to choose a new name (Nip!) and that he needed to tend the seed of hope we heroes have planted.
The townsfolk have become very attached to Old Bum/Nip and are delighted to have him up and about! A huge party happens with several people we remember, including Skug, the dwarf who helped Pyre and Pamykos make the Keytar; Jambaroni, Pamykos’ bardic rival, who starts a big party brawl that Nip ends up winning because everyone loves him that much, and more! Jambaroni reconciles with Pamykos after the latter wins a music battle with his keytar. Jambaroni concedes that Pamykos was a better bard and adventurer, as proven by their arena battle, and Pamykos says it’s all water under the bridge.
The barkeep, Old Garrick, is serving all kinds of alcohol, including eldritch wine, chaos cider, and one of Ratan’s latest brews called Raven’s reward. We all try some Raven’s Reward, causing us to chuck up some consumable magic rewards; and Pyre and Khada (and Okurak? We’ll find out next time) try some of the rest. The newest version of Eldritch Wine lets you choose between three of its possible effects, and Khada gains the ability to ask a tree three questions, which causes some shenanigans with Pyre and a tree, potentially involving tree marriage.
Next some awesome food is served, including Nip’s Notorious Turnip Stew, which tastes like hope, Chauntea’s blessed bread, Probability Puddings (which confuses a few of us), Skug’s Strength Stew (which causes a few of us to only be able to communicate in grunts for an hour), Peculiarity Pies, and Ratan’s Riddle Rolls. We save some of Chauntea’s bread since it works like a short rest! All sorts of strange magical effects and word-based puzzles are unleashed.
16/10/25
Khada and Kalmia also drink some raven’s reward. Kalmia hurls up a potion of superior healing, and Khada got a spell scroll of abidalzim’s horrid wilting. Pamykos’ reward turned out to be a scroll of time stop, and Pyre got mass heal! Furthermore, because of Mystra’s boon, we realise we have the ability to understand and cast these spells using the scroll without testing our arcane knowledge against the scroll’s magic!
After all the festivities, everyone begins settling down. Ratan says an official welcome back to the world of the living for Nip, and everyone begins to bid us farewell! Nip gives us a magic turnip seed that can help us in our moment of greatest need so long as we can plant it with hope. Arabella heals all of our wounds from planeswalking, blesses us all Ratan gives us some provisions including a potion of dragon’s majesty, 2 speed potions, 10 supreme healing potions and 2 vitality potions.
With our farewells sent, we decide to planeswalk to Hades. We’ve spent enough time in the calm before the storm. As soon as we emerge from the portal, we’re struck by the oppressive atmosphere of the Grey Wastes. Everything around and about us dulls, and we’re left standing in endless fields of ash. A huge obsidian tower pierces the sky some distance away, and Fazrahl’s voice booms out at us. He welcomes us to what he says will be our final resting place. He has been waiting for us.
Pamykos sends Reyk up to scout, but through his raven’s eyes he cannot discern much, other than that there is something kind of near the tower. As we trudge across the ashen fields toward the tower, occasional swirling mists form nearby before collapsing. We get some of the way there, before two of these mists coalesce into massive wraiths that block our path. We ready our weapons.
Kalmia gets a potent shot off at one of the wraiths, but the other stuns us for two rounds with a screech. The two wraiths lash out at us with shadowy tendrils and twin blades. One of them then splits itself with its own daggers, ensnaring us all with some more gross shadowy wrappings that deal an unbelievable amount of damage (except to Pamykos who is psychic immune, and Kalmia is resistant but still takes a lot). Pyre is saved by his divine resurrection but would otherwise have gone down. We retaliate as we’re able, though they continue slicing and dicing at us. Pamykos nullifies a volley of magical attacks against him from one wraith, but the other wraith lashes out at Khada and Kalmia, with Khada also being saved by divine immortality.
Khada critically strikes one of the wraiths, exposing its weaknesses with a wild weapon surge before striking it again. Pamykos finishes that one off with his keytar, also healing Pyre, and we turn our attention to the next wraith. Kalmia breaks her damage record again (342!). After some more traded attacks, the other wraith also unleashes that devastating wrapping attack, which downs Pyre and Khada. Pamykos revives them by using Mystra’s boon to cast mass cure wounds. Pyre manages to bring down the wraith with two fiery chromatic orb, but we’re all very hurt, and we’ve all had some of our vitality drained.
Before we can think about healing, we realise we’re within visual range of that thing near the tower. It’s a cloud of darkness trapped in a sphere, lashing out at… a parrot speaking incantations in a familiar voice? It sees us and calls out in recognition to Pyre and Pamykos. It’s Stingston Stallone! He says he got trapped here with this void fiend, which is feeding on his negativity and whispering mean things at him, while researching while the walls of reality were breaking down, and says that if we help him he can help us! We free him using a mix of compliments, athleticism, insight, religion, and investigation, and the bubble holding the void fiend collapses and pops the fiend out of existence. Stingston, now free, turns himself and his stuff back to normal by retrieving his ring. He gives us a token that will let us bypass the sentinels guarding Fazrahl’s tower, and just as excellent, he’s created a safe zone outside of time, where we can rest as long as we need! To use the remaining charges on his keytar first, Pamykos casts song of destiny three times on each of Khada, and Kalmia, and Pyre, making the next d20 they roll a natural 20! We then take a long rest (and we’ve all leveled up!), and Pamykos prepares to give us all a heroes’ feast before we set off for the final battle.
