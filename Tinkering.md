# Wild Magic Tinkering System

As a wild magic sorcerer with tinkering interests, your creations are unpredictable and imbued with chaotic arcane energy. Rather than creating precisely engineered devices, you craft "chaos gadgets" that tap into your innate wild magic.

## Core Mechanics
1. You can attempt to create any gadget by gathering appropriate materials
2. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check + proficiency with tinker's tools. DM rolls.
3. On success, you create the gadget with intended effect
4. All gadgets have a Chaos Rating (1-5)
5. When using a gadget, roll a d20 - if you roll equal to or under the Chaos Rating, a Wild Magic effect occurs

### Difficulty Classes
| Complexity | Examples | DC | Creation Time | Material Cost | Chaos Rating |
|------------|----------|----|--------------|--------------:|--------------|
| Simple | Alarm, light emitter, small trap | 10 | 1 hour | 10gp | 1 |
| Basic | Smoke bomb, grappling mechanism, lock bypass | 13 | 2 hours | 25gp | 2 |
| Moderate | Explosive device, climbing claws, voice amplifier | 15 | 4 hours | 50gp | 3 |
| Complex | Portable turret, gliding device, arcane detector | 18 | 8 hours | 100gp | 4 |
| Advanced | Autonomous assistant, elemental container, teleporter | 20 | 16 hours | 250gp+ | 5 |

### How Chaos Rating Works

#### The Basics
Every gadget has a Chaos Rating (CR) from 1-5, representing how unstable and unpredictable it is:
- CR 1: Minimal chaos, rarely causes problems (5% chance)
- CR 2: Slightly unstable, occasional oddities (10% chance)
- CR 3: Moderately unpredictable, notable chaotic potential (15% chance)
- CR 4: Highly unstable, frequent wild effects (20% chance)
- CR 5: Extremely chaotic, barely contained wild magic (25% chance)

#### Triggering Wild Magic
When a gadget is **activated or used**:
1. The player rolls a d20
2. If the roll is equal to or less than the gadget's Chaos Rating, a Wild Magic effect occurs
3. The DM rolls on the appropriate Wild Magic Effects table secretly
4. The gadget still performs its intended function, but with the additional chaotic effect

### Wild Magic Integration
When crafting, you can choose to infuse your wild magic into the gadget:
- **Controlled Infusion:** Add your Charisma modifier to the crafting check, but increase the Chaos Rating by 1
- **Chaotic Infusion:** Roll on Wild Magic Surge table during crafting; if beneficial result, the item gains that property; if negative, the Chaos Rating increases by 1d4

### Enhancing or Reducing Chaos
- **Controlled Crafting**: By taking extra time (×1.5) during crafting, reduce CR by 1 (minimum 1)
- **Chaotic Crafting**: By rushing (half time), CR increases by 1 (maximum 5)
- **Sorcery Points**: Spend sorcery points equal to the gadget's CR to prevent a wild magic trigger once
- **Wild Zones**: Creating or using gadgets in areas of wild magic automatically increases CR by 1

- Chaos shards (from areas of wild magic)
- Enchanted oils and lubricants
- Alchemical compounds

## Finding Materials
- Duke Arfan's lab is an excellent source of rare components
