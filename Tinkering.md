## Wild Magic Tinkering System

As a wild magic sorcerer with tinkering interests, your creations are unpredictable and imbued with chaotic arcane energy. Rather than creating precisely engineered devices, you craft "chaos gadgets" that tap into your innate wild magic.

### Core Mechanics
1. You can attempt to create any gadget by gathering appropriate materials
2. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check + proficiency with tinker's tools
3. On success, you create the gadget with intended effect
4. All gadgets have a Chaos Rating (1-5)
5. When using a gadget, roll a d20 - if you roll equal to or under the Chaos Rating, a Wild Magic effect occurs

### Difficulty Classes
| Complexity | Examples | DC | Creation Time | Material Cost | Chaos Rating |
|------------|----------|----|--------------|--------------:|--------------|
| Simple | Alarm, light emitter, small trap | 10 | 1 hour | 10gp | 1 |
| Basic | Smoke bomb, grappling mechanism, lock bypass | 13 | 2 hours | 25gp | 2 |
| Moderate | Explosive device, climbing claws, voice amplifier | 15 | 4 hours | 50gp | 3 |
| Complex | Portable turret, gliding device, arcane detector | 18 | 8 hours | 100gp | 4 |
| Advanced | Autonomous assistant, elemental container, teleporter | 20 | 16 hours | 250gp+ | 5 |

### Wild Magic Integration
When crafting, you can choose to infuse your wild magic into the gadget:
- **Controlled Infusion:** Add your Charisma modifier to the crafting check, but increase the Chaos Rating by 1
- **Chaotic Infusion:** Roll on Wild Magic Surge table during crafting; if beneficial result, the item gains that property; if negative, the Chaos Rating increases by 1d4

### Sample Chaos Gadgets

**Fluctuating Firebomb (Moderate)**
- DC 15 to craft
- 50gp of materials

### Chaotic Mishaps Table (Roll 1d8 on failed crafting checks)
1. Parts assemble into a completely different gadget
2. Device works but causes a wild magic surge when activated
3. Item appears normal but affects random target within 30ft
4. Gadget has opposite of intended effect
5. Creates miniature wild magic storm in 10ft radius
6. Works perfectly but makes loud noises and colorful lights
7. Functions correctly but changes user's appearance for 1d4 hours
8. Item works but attracts magical beasts when used

### Sorcery Points Integration
You can spend sorcery points when crafting to:
- Reduce crafting DC by 1 per point (max 5)
- Reduce Chaos Rating by 1 per point (min 1)
- Add additional uses (1 point per use)
- Add metamagic effects to gadget (cost varies)
